Fasten your seat belt for an exciting ride ahead. Enjoy a good mood and witty conversation with others.

You can make real headway pursuing a long term ambition if you apply yourself.

 <pattern>* ARIES *</pattern>
 <template><random>
<li>ARIES (March 21-April 19)<br>  You've got to taste your freedom today in order to feel fabulous. A partner wants more of you, but anything that obligates you will turn you off. Work to overcome the differences in your love life -- you can do it. 
<li>aries <br>  Adventurous day. Do you feel like having an adventure? Well today, you're more likely to have an adventure when you go on a short journey. No need to go very far, just someplace you've wanted to go before, yet never been. Today is also a good day to surprise a close friend with news or a small gift love*** money**** work*** 
<li>Your dreams and intuition may take on a rather humanitarian quality today, dear Aries. You may find that your fire has been ignited by a huge gust of wind and perhaps you are inspired to go on a crusade for peace. Either way, you heart wants freedom. Take deep breaths and get your blood pumping. Movement is a key element to the day. 
<li>With your passions very much ruling your head, you could be surprised by the new  experiences you jump head first into not giving a thought to what others may  think. And this is your great strength when you are prepared to experiment,  taking a 'check it and see' approach to evaluating what is good for you. 
<li>A strong sensitivity to the thoughts and feelings of others is tempered by a sense of purpose and stability today, dear Aries.

 <pattern>* CANCER *</pattern>
 <template><random>
<li>CANCER (June 22-July 22) <br>  Travel or foreign intrigue is strong. You are able to see things from a new and more mature vantage point. Singles could meet fantastic love by helping others. Getting bills paid is easy tonight. 
<li>cancer <br>  Take time for both. Today you'll have dual needs. On one hand, you'll want to take part in social activities. And at the same time, you'll need some time alone. Fortunately, you can and should do both! Today plan time with others, and also try to find someplace quiet where you can spend an hour alone. 
<li>Jump-start your day with a cold shower, dear Cancer. You will find that the more you sit around and watch TV, the more lazy and sleepy you will feel. The drowsiness is contagious. As soon as you get up and get moving, however, you should find that a second wind kicks up and rejuvenates you. Activity will give you more energy and you will find that there is little to keep you down. The hardest step is taking the first step. 
<li>With your readiness to push on through to get a result over high finances and  bold enterprises you are not about to take a softly softly approach to making  things happen. Although you are well aware that the stakes are enormous if it  all goes wrong, something tells you that now is the time for striking while the  iron is hot.

 <pattern>* CAPRICORN *</pattern>
 <template><random>
<li>CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) <br>  Give a project a rest -- this boosts your energy for those neglected areas of your personal life. An avoided task is brought to your attention. Intellect is attractive, so don't hide your smarts! It's sexy to debate with a date. 
<li>capricorn <br>  Better shape. Great day to focus on bettering your health. That's because today your health and physical wellbeing are in stronger focus. To help achieve the best results today, try to focus mostly on eating healthy foods, and on getting enough rest for your body to rebuild its natural defenses. 
<li>People may not have a very long attention span today, dear Capricorn, and so you may find that your opinions aren't getting the respect that they deserve. Don't take it personally. Information is buzzing around as if you are in a beehive. There is not always an easy way to contain it or make sense of it so don't even bother trying. Try to consume things in small bits instead of ingesting it all at once. 
<li>You are more than prepared to take drastic steps to bring finality and closure  to one issue. It is wise to keep a strict control over your powerful desire to  get revenge as things could easily get out of hand if you do let your lesser  motives get into the driving seat. Beware of powerful people who are capable of  dirty tricks.

If you can channel your energies in  positive directions you are able to persuade just about anyone of the rightness  of your proposals and suggestions, Seduction is on the cards for some.

 <pattern>* LEO *</pattern>
 <template><random>
<li>LEO (July 23-Aug. 22) <br>  Loved ones adore you but may not share your perspective. Hidden emotions and things buried from the past could have you in the mood to retreat. Children test your tolerance, too. This is definitely a night to do what you love. 
<li>leo <br>  People power. To feel your best today, spend more time socializing with others. Attending a party would fit the bill perfectly! But, that's not the only solution. You can also go to any crowded public place where you can mingle with lots of people. Great day to go to a popular restaurant, movie theater or store. 
<li>You may find yourself in a bit of a funk today for no apparent reason, dear Leo. It could be that the smallest actions of others are rubbing you the wrong way. Perhaps you need to spend some time alone to reconnect with yourself. Remember that you don't need to have the approval of everyone around you in order to feel comfortable and self-confident. This is a feeling that should come from within. 
<li>Your enthusiastic pursuit of your own agenda and wishes is so catching and all  pervasive that other people are very unlikely to step in your way. In romance  you can easily veer into obsession, fixation and a complete lack of inhibition  as you see what you want and go all out to get it, come what may.

 <pattern>* PISCES *</pattern>
 <template><random>
<li>PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20)<br>  Words of caution from a loved one are based only on an assumption, but don't completely disregard them. A kindred spirit makes suggestions that you'd be wise to follow. Misunderstandings can be cleared up quickly.

<li>SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) <br>  You are sometimes loyal to a fault. Get tough. After all, if you are not your own advocate, how can you expect anyone else to be? Truths are revealed in the pursuit of intimacy. Cancer contacts are lucky. 
<li>sagittarius <br>  Relationship elevator going up. Today you'll want to spend more time with someone you find special. That's because today the stage is set for your relationships to improve and mature. If possible, try planning something unique with that someone special. And don't let outside influences interrupt your time together. 
<li>Listen to the viewpoint of others and make careful note, dear Sagittarius. It could be that in your quest for adventure and freedom, you are not keeping tabs on the people you are directly affecting. Keep the information flowing through you. There is a great deal of air to fuel your fire today, so take advantage of the heat but be careful that you don't burn yourself or the people around you. 
<li>You are so committed to exploring your beliefs and putting your ideas into  action that it would be impossible to talk you out of them. This kind of  commitment speaks volumes to people who see you are deadly determined to go your  own way and lead from the front.

 <pattern>* SCORPIO *</pattern>
 <template><random>
<li>SCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21) <br>  Stress could tempt you to overdo and overindulge, so quit it! Relax when you need to. Make the most of leisure time by refusing to go along with the group until you have carefully considered the options. 
<li>scorpio <br>  Can you avoid money? Today you may want to try! That's because today your judgment regarding the use of money is at below normal levels. Try putting off any major purchases or investments. You'll also want to avoid advising others how to spend their money. Tomorrow things will be back to normal. 
<li>You may run into difficult roadblocks today that seemed to have cropped up out of nowhere. Don't doubt yourself any longer, dear Scorpio. Keep your internal compass focused on true north and try not to let other people's energies get in the way of your dreams. Things are moving fast and furiously and it may be hard for you to make a meaningful connection with people and situations at this time. Resume connection when you feel more ready. 
<li>The time seems exactly right for you to make bold moves in pursuit of highly ambitious targets. While you might ordinarily be rather nervous at handling large sums, or negotiating over big loans or important issues, you surprise  yourself with your apparently nerve less pursuit of what needs to be done with scarce a backward glance.

<li>TAURUS (April 20-May 20) <br>  There are people who will support your ideas, although you might not know who they are yet. Get out there, and shake some hands. Practical financial choices benefit you in numerous ways. Include children in the fun! 
<li>taurus <br>  Different strokes for different folks. Today, more people around you will differ in their beliefs from yours.

<li>You may be trying to get a handle on things today, dear Taurus, yet it may not seem to be working at all. Finding your grounding is difficult when everything is up in the air.

 <pattern>* VIRGO *</pattern>
 <template><random>
<li>VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) <br>  You are less limited than you think you are. Much can be overcome with ingenuity instead of manpower. What you perceived as a wolf at the door turns out to be a gift-bearer! 
<li>virgo <br>  Out in front. Today your leadership skills are stronger than usual. So much so, that you should put yourself into situations where you can take a greater leadership role. You'll find you're especially effective when you get out in front and lead others by example. Great day to invite friends to join you. 
<li>Things may be flying around you left and right without any rhyme or reason, dear Virgo. Just go with the flow! If you stop and try to analyze everything, you may waste valuable time. Trust in others and the information that is coming your way. Making sense of it all may be almost impossible, so don't worry if there are questions that remain unanswered. Things will work themselves as they need to. 
<li>There are some very determined people you have to contend with but this should  not persuade you to give up any rightful claims you believe you have over them.  When push comes to shove you have the power within you to move in secrecy and give any opponents a real upset since you know where the bodies are buried.
