<li>When planning your future always include pretzels.
<li>Take time today to thank the little people <nextreply> .......in bed
<li>You look great, and you know it!<nextreply> .......in bed
<li>you have unusual equipment for success, use it properly <nextreply> .........in bed
<li>Help!!! I'm being held in a Chinese bakery Lucky numbers:6,13,19,33,34,43(i really got this one lol)
<li>3 WOMAN!!!!!!!!! <nextreply> Lucky numbers:6,66,69,669,6669
<li>The greatest danger could be your stupidity(really got this one)<nextreply> .........in bed
<li>A starship ride has been promised to you by the galactic wizard (if you get a fortune like this here's a tip: don't eat the cookie even though they taste sooooooooooo good)
<li>About the fortunes I give you. <nextreply>You have probably noticed that some containsa little fine print entitled &quot;lucky numbers&quot;. Some people believe that any unusual occurrence<nextreply> -- e.g. pulling a piece of paper out of a fortune cookie with an odd message on it -- portends genuine luck. In fact I dare say <nextreply>there are some folks that would be willing to risk quite a bit of money on the lucky numbers found on these pages.<nextreply> Now, I'm not one to criticize anybody's superstitions or taste in recreation <nextreply>(unless you listen to country music... in which case you're a hick, I tell you, a hopeless hick.) <nextreply> But the simple fact is that even if Big Bird jumps out of a doorway and hands you a set of &quot;lucky numbers&quot;, they're probably not worth much more than the paper they're written on.<nextrepl>What I'm getting at is this: if you actually use those lucky numbers in a gambling enterprise of some kind, you're on your own. Don't look at me when you come out empty-handed.<nextreply>In fact, if you would even consider using &quot;lucky numbers&quot; given to you by a fortune that tells you that you're stupid, you need to do the following:<nextreply>1. Go get a dictionary and look up the word irony.<nextreply>2.Mark the page so you won't lose it in the next step.<nextreply>3. Beat yourself over the head with the dictionary and repeat the phrase &quot;I am unfit to live without supervision&quot; 300 times.
<li>You will receive a fortune cookie
<li>You have no future<nextreply> .......in bed
<li>You will come back to this restaurant and buy LOTS of food for no reason
<li>You like Chinese food
<li>you will findoverpaid for this fake Chinese crap

<li>Like most men, I am consumed with desire whenever a lesbian gets within twenty feet
<li>Sex without love is an empty experience, but as empty experiences go it's a pretty good one
<li>Don't have sex man. It leads to kissing and pretty soon you have to start talking to them
<li>&quot;I'm a double bagger. Not only does my husband put a bag over my face when we're making love, but he also puts a bag over his head in case mine falls off.&quot; Joan Rivers

<li>The appropriate age for marriage is around eighteen for girls and thirty-seven for men
<li>What ought to be done to the man who invented the celebrating of anniversaries? Mere killing would be too light
<li>Some people ask the secret of our long marriage. We take time to go to a restaurant two times a week. A little candlelight, dinner, soft music and dancing. She goes Tuesdays, I go Fridays
<li>We sleep in separate rooms, we have dinner apart, we take separate vacations. We're doing everything we can to keep our marriage together
