<li>To alcohol! The cause of -- and solution to -- all of life's problems!
<li>Well, you know boys, a nuclear reactor is a lot like a woman. You just  have to read the manual and press the right button.
<li>This is the greatest thrill of my life!  I'm king of the world! Wooo, wooo! Wooo, wooo!
<li>Burns: I can't understand a word you're saying. Homer: My name is Homer Simpson! Burns: You're just babbling incoherently... Homer: Oh, you're a dead man, Burns.  Oh, you're dead! You're dead, Burns!
<li>I can't live the button-down life like you. I want it all! The terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles!
<li>TV Announcer:  The following is a public service announcement: Excessive alcohol consumption can cause liver damage and cancer of the rectum. Homer: Mmm ... beer.
<li>A boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center.
<li>Hee, hee!  I can be a jerk and no one can stop me!
<li>So, like us, let your children run wild and free, because as the old saying goes: let your children run wild and free.
<li>Mmm...incapacitating.
<li>It takes two to lie.  One to lie and one to listen.
<li>Woman: Your son was trespassing on my property and destroyed a very valuable stone gargoyle, and -- Are you wearing a grocery bag? Homer: I have misplaced my pants.
<li>This is even more painful than it looks.
<li>As far as anyone knows we're a nice, normal family.
