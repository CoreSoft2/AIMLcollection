 <pattern>360 FLIP</pattern>
 <template>To do a 360 flip, you should first be able to do a varial flip and 360 Pop Shove-it. First put your back foot on the back right edge of the board (back left edge if you are goofy) and put it at an angle so it is on the very edge of the tail. Then put your front foot a couple inches towards you from the middle of the board and then slant your foot the same way you did on your back foot. Now it's time to do the trick. Set up bend your knees and hit your tail while sliding your front foot forward. Through your back foot behind you as quickly as you can as you hit your tail spinning the board till it rotates all the way around. While doing this slide your front foot off the edge of the board using your toe to flip it. Your board does not have to go high just as long as it gets around. You can work on the hieght later. Once it has finished rotating catch the board with your feet and land on it. That's pretty much it. Oh yeah, and then ride away. Bet you didn't do it. If you did, good job.</template>

 <pattern>360 SHOVE IT</pattern>
 <template>You'll have to try putting your feet a few different ways. The best way is to put your feet kind of like an ollie and scoot your front foot towards your back a bunch. The most important thing is to keep the board from flipping, so you don't land prematurely or overmaturely.Hit your tail and swing your back foot back. Jump. You want to use the power in your back foot for it.Try to shoot it around fast and grab it with your feet.</template>

 <pattern>5-0 GRIND</pattern>
 <template>Ride towards the curb at hardly any angle at all, and don't go very fast at first. (By the way, since you aren't going very fast, make sure the curb is waxed well first, moron.    Now ollie and land on the curb with only your back truck, not your front at all, and drag your tail. Kind of like a crappy manual on the edge of the curb with one wheel hanging off.    It is VERY important that you don't lean back to much. The biggest danger is slipping out, so don't!    Try to keep yourself balanced, and slide as long as you can. When you're done, come off the same way you do on a 50-50.</template>
</category>
<category>
 <pattern>50-50 GRIND</pattern>
 <template>Approach the ledge or rail you are going to grind either at a 45 degree angle or less. (I find the the 45 degree angle a little bit more difficult to pull-off, but easier get onto.) Ollie at an angle with your front foot first and your back foot following until you land on the ledge/rail. You want to ollie just high enough to get on, but not too high or you will slam your trucks really hard. Once you start sliding, keep your weight over the center of the board. If possible, have your back foot on the tail. On curbs and low ledges, you can just roll out of it sometimes, but if it is higher you either need to drop or ollie out of it. to drop it, just keep your weight over the back truck and manual until you fall. To ollie out, pop the tail and fall to the ground. When you land, keep your weight centered and try not to slip out. Stay balanced and ride away smooth.</template>

 <pattern>BACKSIDE 180</pattern>
 <template>The Backside 180 ollie is not much different than the frontside 180 ollie, in that, you're still turning a 180, but you are turning forwards instead of backwards. To learn the backside 180 ollie, it is recomended that you learn the ollie and the frontside 180 ollie first. Once learned you may attempt the trick. When doing the backside 180 ollie, you would need to rely on your windup a lot more than that of the frontside 180 ollie. You must windup as muchas possible, and then release that windup and spin 180 with the board. If you have a lot of trouble with spinning all the way around, try doing half-cabs instead. They are easier for some people.</template>

<category>
 <pattern>BACKSIDE BOARDSLIDE</pattern>
 <template>1) Approach the thing that you're going to slide at a straight angle about half a foot away from it at a good speed that you feel comforble at.  2) When you come up next to it do a 90* ollie on to the thing you're going to slide.  3) When you land on the thing you're going to slide put your weight on to your heels. (If you are sliding the way you're facing.)  4) If you did that right the board will slide. Now to get off this depends on what you are sliding on. If its one of those bike racks that you turn upside down or anything that just stops with nothing in the way of your wheals then all you do is turn your body (and feet) the way you want to get off. But if it does corner or there are things in the way of your wheals then you are going to have to go up on a 30* angleto clear it.  This can be a cool looking move. When you get good at it you can slide things quite long. To do this you need more speed.</template>

 <pattern>BIG SPIN</pattern>
 <template>A big spin is a 360 pop shove-it with a backside body varial. OR... a backside 180 with an extra pop shove-it. To do a big spin you should first know how to do backside 180's and pop shove-it's. Once you can do those you should be ready to attempt a big spin. Even though a big spin sounds hard, it really isn't.You should first try a big spin riding fakie (backwards). Ride fakie. Then wind up your body like you are going to backside half-cab. Then ollie and unwind. As you spin around towards your stomach and are about to land kick your board ian the same direction you are spinning. In other words you should make the board continue its previous spin and speed up faster than you are so that it spins another 180 really quickly before you land it.</template>

<category>
 <pattern>BIG SPIN KICKFLIP</pattern>
 <template>1. Ride really fast.  2. Put your feet the same as a 360 flip.  3. Turn your upper body in a backside 180 and when in 90 degrees pop a 360 flip but dont lose your turning momentum. Its important that you wind up your body and not begin the flip trick until you have already begun to spin your body and your body has turned 90 degrees. I.e. You feet are following your upper body around. Your upper body is not following your feet.  4. Land with style.  5. You must have as much momentum as possible when turning.</template>

 <pattern>BLUNTSLIDE</pattern>
 <template>1) Roll towards the obstacle at a good speed and at an angle between 10 and 35 degrees.  2) Snap the tail and pull your front foot up and in as high as it will go.  3) Bring your back foot up with it but as the obstacle comes beneath you, push your back foot down so that you land on the ledge/curb with your tail down and your board pointing close to vertically.  4) On contact, push your back foot forward and lean back. Compensate this lean by keeping your shoulders straight and forward. This should let you slide.  5) Slide  6) As you near the end of your your slide, put a bit of extra weight on your front foot so that the board tilts to less of a vertical angle. This prepares you to be able to snap out of this trick.  7) Push your tail down hard and jump away from the obstacle.  8) Bring your back foot in as close to your body as it will come and pull up and in with your front foot.   9) Push your front foot forward and down while rotaing your ankle.   10) Land cleanly and roll away.   11) Listen to the applause.</template>

 <pattern>DARKSLIDE|DARK SLIDE</pattern>
 <template>To do a Frontside Darksilde first you need to know how to boardslide, kickflip, and how to do shove-its out of boardslides. Start by aproaching the object (flatbars are the best) as you would for a fronstide boardslide but more room for the ollie. Start by putting your front foot near the bolts (this is so when you kickflip the board will not spin all the way around) next, ollie and do a kickfip. Make sure it only goes half way around, duh! now the hard part. You have to catch your board by the trucks with your feet on the opposite ends of the board. After you manage to do this slide the rail as far as possible. Getting off is no easy task either. I find the best way is to pick up your front foot and move it out and up. The board will then turn rightside up. After this turn your body and come off fakie.(this sounds harder, but trust me, its alot easier this way.) Land with your knees bent and roll away.</template>

 <pattern>FRONTSIDE 180</pattern>
 <template>As you can probobly tell from the name (Unless you're stupid.), it is imperitive that you learn the ollie first. The First thing you have to do is prepare for the ollie. Then windup by reaching with your leading hand, across your chest and squat down. Ollie. As you ascend (go up), unwind (i.e. untwist your body)! As you turn your feet should bring your board around with you.After you have turned 180 degrees (half-way around) frontside, land.</template>
</category>
<category>
 <pattern>FRONTSIDE BOARDSLIDE</pattern>
 <template>1) Approach the object at a pretty fast speed. On this trick, if you go to slow you will stick and fall on your back.  2) Now approaching frontside, ollie at a 90 degree angle and slide.  3) While you are sliding center you lower body out with the rail. Your upper body should be turned around so you can see where you are going and it gives you better balance.  4) As you approach the end of your obstacle, turn out 90 degrees and roll away and show off.</template>

 <pattern>HARD FLIP</pattern>
 <template>For a hard flip, place your back foot on the tail and your front foot pointed somewhat forward near the heel edge. Hit the tail while sliding your front foot off of the board making it seem to come straight up at you. It will look like it is going to do a flip and land upside down, but with practice you will learn to make it perform a half-flip and land on its wheels. (You may want to try this without trying to land it the first couple of times.) At the same time, you will want to be rotating your body 90� in the frontside direction letting the board flip between your legs. When the board has finished rotating, rotate your body back to your normal stance and catch the board before it hits the ground.</template>
</category>
<category>
 <pattern>HEELFLIP</pattern>
 <template>Keep your back toe on the center of the tail. Your front foot should be at a little bit more than a 45 degree angle. It should be in the center of the board with your toe hanging over the toe edge.  Hit the tail. As you do this, slide your front foot forward at an angle and just before it hits the nose, bend your foot/angle it and flip the board over the toe edge with the toe of your foot. Jump.  Wait for the board to rotate. When it comes around, bring knees up and stop it with your feet.</template>

 <pattern>K-GRIND|CROOKED GRIND|KROOKED GRIND</pattern>
 <template>To do this trick, you should first be able to do basic grinds, and duh, ollie. Nose manualing experience may help. But you could not know how to nose manual and just be an idiot. Go ahead. Ride up to the ledge or rail at a slight angle, as you would for a 50-50. Put your front foot near the bolts depending upon how high the ledge is. Ollie and immediately slide your foot up on to the nose and put pressure on it to lock it against the rail or other obstacle. Your board should be crooked on the rail/ledge. This means that unlike a nosegrind where your board is paralel with the grinding edge, your tail (the one sticking up in the air) should be pinting away from the rail as much as possible behind you. The idea is the k-grind is a crooked grind, so it should be crooked. Keep most of your weight on your nose (front foot) and just a little bit on your back foot so you don't sqeek to a stop. Slide as far as is humanly possible. If the ledge ends, simply slide off and level out, but if it doesn't, pivot your front foot until it sildes off. Level out and try to land parralel to the obstacle. Then make sure you watch where you are going, cuz you might ride into a wall and look really stupid.</template>

<category>
 <pattern>KICKFLIP</pattern>
 <template>First get into an ollie position. Then move your front foot to the edge of the board. Ollie, and then as you slide your foot up as in an ollie, push or kick (thus getting the name &quot;The kickflip&quot;) board and move your feet on to it.</template>
</category>
<category>
 <pattern>NOLLIE</pattern>
 <template>In order to do the nollie you must become quite formiliar with the switch-stance ollie. Then you should begin riding normal (If you're goofy ride goofy and if regular then ride accordingly). As you are moving, set up your feet for a switch ollie off the nose. Follow directions of an ollie except off the nose.</template>
</category>
<category>
 <pattern>NOLLIE FLIP</pattern>
 <template>1) Set up going forward just like you do a kickflip, but in the nollie position.  2) You should already know how to nollie and flip the board, nollie.  3) Before you try landing them going nollie, try switch kickflips on carpet or on grass.  4) Once you can land them, try them going nollie.  5) Hit the nose and flip the board whichever way you feel most comfortable.  6) It helps to jump really high to have more accuracy when you land on the board.  7) Balance your weight and ride away. Don't slip out. It hurts!</template>

<category>
 <pattern>NOSE GRIND</pattern>
 <template>Approach the ledge at a good speed. (Never slow!)   When you reach your ledge (a VERY slight angle), make sure that your front foot is near the 2 back bolts on the front truck.   Ollie high enough for the front truck to be a little bit above the ledge.   In the air, put pressure on the nose of the deck so that the board's front truck is on the ledge. Then push foward so that it will grind more easily.   When you are at the end of the ledge lean back just a little so you can get off of it and land.   **When you are grinding, you have to lean to towards the ledge. This will put pressure on the wheel that's on there and you will grind more smoothly. You shouldn't do this on a railing because you will fall.</template>
</category>
<category>
 <pattern>NOSE SLIDE</pattern>
 <template>Note: This trick is for people who skateboard regular foot. If you are goofy, just reverse everything.    1)Roll at a good pace toward the object.  2)Try and be either parallel to the object or rolling towards it at a slight angle.  3)When you're close enough, pop the board up and turn the board so it meets the object with it's nose. Tip - When trying to turn the board, use your body and your legs at the same time, you want to have your body facing sideways to the object.  4)Slide, Slide, Slide...  5)If you want to loand regular, simply lean your back foot backwards 90 degrees near the end, as well as your body and legs. If you want to land switch, lean forward when your sliding and turn your body and legs 90 degrees forward.  6)Roll away.    Hints and Tips - To land the trick regular or switch, you need to use both your body and your legs to turn, no just your feet. If helps in you lean forward to land switch, and lean back if you want to land regular.</template>

 <pattern>NOSEBLUNTSLIDE</pattern>
 <template>Step 1: Practice become farmiliar with frontside 180 ollies and regular ollies.  Step 2: Approach the block at a slight angle. Then ollie to a 90 degre angle sticking your nose into a noseblunt slide position.  Step 3: Keep most of (but not all) of your weight on the nose.  Step 4: Make sure that your body stays facing forward.  Step 5: At the end of the block, give your nose a little nollie - Come out forward or fakie.  Step 6: Ride away cleanly.  Note: Article stolen from Transworld Magazine, Volume 16, #4, April 1998.</template>

 <pattern>OLLIE</pattern>
 <template>1)stand on the board with your back foot on the tail and your front foot in the middle of the deck.  2)crouch down til your hands are almost touching the ground  3)slam down on the tail while sliding the blade of your front foot up torwards the tail.  4)jump up off your back foot and tuck both knees into your chest.  5)extend your legs slightly to prepare for the shock of the landing.  6)land and absorb the force in your legs.   7)ride off.    *try to do steps 3 and 4 at almost the same time.  *learn this while moving because it sucks if you learn it still then have to learn it all over again moving.  *when you land keep your body centered over the board that way it doesn't fly out from under neath you and make you look [dumb].</template>
</category>
<category>
 <pattern>POP SHOVE IT</pattern>
 <template>The first thing you need to do is give it a &quot;pop&quot; (Slam down on that tail.) Now &quot;shove-it&quot; around with your front foot so that the board turns a 180, but you stay in the same place. You ought to learn it standing in place first, and then learn it fakie. After that you can attempt it moving forward.  You can place your feet in different positions for this trick. It all depends on you. Some put their feet sort of the way you would for a kickflip. Others put one foot about on the middle facing straight forward and the other facing straight forward on the tail.  Remember when you do it to jump forward. Because if you just spin out the board and stay in the same place, your board will just fly out and you will look stupid. We wouldn't want that...</template>
</category>
<category>
 <pattern>TAIL SLIDE</pattern>
 <template>To tailslide, approach a curb/funbox/whatever going at a moderate speed like if you want to slide farther then go faster. Act as if you are going to do a 5-0 grind, but instead of just landing your back truck on there, turn your board 90 degrees sideways, and land your tail on there. BE SURE TO KEEP YOUR TAIL DOWN (on the curb) AND YOUR NOSE IN AN UPWARD SLANTING DIRECTION (of the curb). Slide Slide Slide. Then if you can get this part down, coming off of a tailslide is easy -- just lean forward. After you get the hang of it, it rules! It is important, while you're sliding... that you don't lean back too much because you slip out a LOT on this trick... and you do NOT want to land on the corner of a ledge.</template>
