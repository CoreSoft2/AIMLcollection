<li>&quot;The fastest song I ever wrote was one of the sincere songs on the last album. It was called &quot;Evaporated.&quot; Written in literally 15 minutes. As quickly as I could write it down and work the chords out.&quot;  - Ben Folds
<li>&quot;We have a broken distortion pedal. This is a life or death situation, just like Robert getting a haircut.&quot;  - Ben Folds, live at Lupo's 
<li>&quot;Shit... fuck... does anybody know the second verse? Security, let that man through!&quot;  - Ben, at Summerfest, when he forgot the words to Video Killed The Radio Star
<li>&quot;Thanks for inviting us to your home. We were just talking about how nice it was, weren't we Robert?&quot;  - Ben, to Jenny, on The Jenny McCarthy Show's set
<li>&quot;They're a big part of my life.&quot;  - Ben talking about his twins
<li>&quot;People think I'm either a street person or a daddy. Women hold on to their handbags, men avert their glances. It's OK.&quot;  - Ben on whether he is a celebrity in Adelaide
<li>&quot;There are fringe people and there are fringe people, and the truly fringe people are the ones where you open a phone book and you put your finger down, and there's someone's name, and you call 'em up, and they're fucking weird.&quot;  - Ben Folds
<li>&quot;I think that most Americans are rednecks.&quot;  - Ben Folds 
<li>&quot;Piano is really an interesting thing to put in the band before it gets all blown up into a big, y'know, a big MGM cinema huge thing, y'know big sound and stuff?&quot;  - Ben Folds
<li>&quot;Nashville is a nice way to fail.&quot;   -Ben Folds 
<li>&quot;There were a lot of musicians around here I talked to [about starting a piano-bass-drums band] who couldn't see it. But as soon as I started explaining it to [Robert and Darren] they were like, 'Ah, I can see that. I can see that. We didn't have anything else going on in our lives, none of us, so we just worked our asses off.&quot;   -Ben Folds 
<li>&quot;My first gig was when I was 10 years old for a chicken dinner at a church, playing my own stuff that I wrote. These old ladies were coming up and telling me to play quieter and quieter and quieter, 'til finally I was just barely playing piano. I was just getting so fuckin' mad and insulted. Then this woman came up. All of sudden she was being friendly to me; she goes, 'One of the ladies here birthday is today. Could you play 'Happy Birthday'?'   I said, 'Yeah, can I have my chicken dinner first?' I went and got my chicken dinner, and then I just left. [assorted laughter around the table] I was so pissed. I started thinking about playing 'Happy Birthday' and I got so mad, I just took the dinner and left. Walked back down the street; I was about to cry, too. I was so pissed.&quot;   -Ben Folds
<li>&quot;I'm just a piano-playin' asshole...&quot;   -Ben Folds 
<li>&quot;I was a geek I think in high school... yeah, I was.&quot;   -Ben Folds &quot;I see people on the front of stuff and they're all they're striking these poses. Then you see other guys, they're trying so hard to look like they're bored and don't care about it. Why not, I mean, if you get your picture taken for a school photo and that's you, why not put that on the front of your album cover?&quot;   -Ben Folds   
<li>&quot;Oh yeah, now's the time to act like really cool rock stars. I saw this thing with Oasis where they said, 'If you don't like us then you can fuck off.' Well the same applies with us. If you don't like Ben Folds Five you can fuck off!&quot;   -Ben Folds 
<li>&quot;You can oppose yourself and edit yourself all you want, but here's still a little freak inside you that wants to talk.&quot;   -Ben Folds 
<li>&quot;I don't like 'Ben Folds Five' very much at all anymore. It was a good idea when we started, but I know the guys don't like it and it's really uncomfortable for me at this point. But I think 'five' is much better than if we were called something serious like the 'Ben Folds Project' or some shit like that.&quot;   -Ben Folds 
<li>&quot;The only time that [sounding like Billy Joel] has any bearing on what I do is when I write something on the piano and I go, 'Aww shit, that sounds like a Billy Joel song.' And I will change every note to keep it from sounding like a fucking Billy Joel song. And that's when I start to thank God that Robert's here to put the fuzz bass on, or we find some other way to fuck it up somehow.&quot;   -Ben Folds 
<li>&quot;You won�t recognize me now [that we've had kids]. I�m wearing sweat pants and driving a station wagon and listening to Kenny G. The live show will include a slide show of my children while we play �You Light Up My Life.�   The opening act will be a motivational speaker selling his self help books.   All my new songs are about changing diapers and dried upchuck that you find on your shoulder over breakfast at 6:00 AM. Other than that, I�m still the same guy...&quot;   -Ben Folds 
<li>&quot;I spent 8 years writing my songs and trying so hard to make a particular thing happen -- I wanted to put out a record. And the record didn't happen until my goal was just to make music with people I wanted to make music with, have a good time, and do exactly what I wanted to, fuck it if it didn't fit a bill. Then all of a sudden, this band got together and in six months we had a record deal.&quot; 
<li>&quot;I used to think selling thirty or forty thousand records would be the shit,&quot; says Folds, &quot;and if we sell thirty and forty thousand records on this one, it will be shit.&quot; 
<li>&quot;When Ben plays the piano, he hits it very hard.&quot;   -Scotty Folds (Ben's Mom) 
<li>&quot;We'd like to thank Mr. Matthews and his band for letting us play for you here today. Kickin that shit in seven eighths time!&quot;   -Ben Folds, Opening for DMB at Giants Stadium
<li>&quot;Our truck's called Butthole.&quot;   
<li>&quot;C'mon, give me the camera... Don't shoot.&quot;   Ben 
<li>&quot;This is probably gonna be like 'Thriller', or something like that, where every single song, one after another, is just a MAJOR hit.&quot; 
<li>&quot;I've been called a nerd in every possible paper across the United States.&quot; 
<li>&quot;It's not THEE Ben Folds Five, motherfucker.&quot; 
<li>&quot;Goddammit, give me my Goddam coffee! Right fucking now!&quot; 
<li>&quot;I hadn't lived in North Carolina for awhile, so when I came back I just got.. I wanted to start a band so I just called people, who knew people. And my brother knew Robert, so we got together one time and started playing.&quot;
<li>&quot;We've actually gotten good.&quot; (Ben Folds Five)
<li>&quot;Did you see the Devil on the door?&quot;
<li>&quot;We'll take an occasional break, and listen to The Carpenters.&quot; 
<li>&quot;Do you know how many people have gotten their teeth drilled to this?&quot; 
<li>&quot;Here at Subway we make our bread from scratch.&quot; 
<li>&quot;Caleb doesn't really know jack shit about recording.&quot;   
<li>&quot;We get compared alot to, um, people we really don't want to be compared alot to. Like, um, Dokken.&quot;   
<li>&quot;One day we'll record in a real studio.&quot; 
<li>&quot;I have to jump on it.&quot; -referring to his piano   
<li>&quot;I'm a musician, I'm not a lyricist. And I have to find the lyrics inside the music because I don't sit around and write poetry on candy wrappers.&quot; 
<li>&quot;I'm still crossing my fingers. I'm at a bit of a delusional point where I think we've made an important record.&quot;   
<li>&quot;Ben Folds Five, piano bass and drums, three guys with no vision and alot of money.&quot; 
<li>&quot;That's the kind of shit that's gonna be on our new record.&quot;   
<li>&quot;There's a sound, that you associate with Chapel Hill, or I do from being around here, and we don't really fit into that, exactly.&quot; 
<li>&quot;I put the money down on the piano without really knowing if I could even amplify it or not, and I didn't know what I was doing, didn't know how to move it or anything I just knew that if I'm going to do this, I have to have a real piano because I tried it on a digital piano and they suck.&quot; 
<li>&quot;I had a bad home movie experiance when I was little.&quot;   
<li>&quot;I guess, you know, I looked a little bit like um, who was that? The guy in Wang Chung.&quot; 
<li>&quot;We were Dear Rosetta Stone for two gigs, and now we're not.&quot; 
<li>&quot;My name is Benjamin Scott Folds, I play piano in this band.&quot; 
<li>&quot;That's funny, 'cause we're stunt musicians.&quot;
<li>&quot;She handles better than any I've ever driven before.&quot;   
<li>&quot;Thanks for inviting us to your home. We were just talking about how nice it was, weren't we Robert?&quot; 
<li>&quot;Robert couldnt perform the function.&quot; 
<li>&quot;I was writing when I started playing piano. That's kinda, I think, probably why I started playing, because I wanted to make up my own songs.&quot; 
<li>&quot;We're not making concessions for the piano, like it has to be like Lion King soundtrack or something.&quot;   
<li>&quot;The only good thing to come out of this record is that I have something to say to the cashier when I take my record back, which is 'Give me money back you bitch'.&quot;   
<li>&quot;He's like the Mohammed Ali of Europe, or something.&quot;   
<li>&quot;I set myself up to be ready to be fifty years old and to be absolutely totally broke and to be playing in the corner of a room smaller than this.&quot; 
<li>&quot;Darren's a great song writer. Or he'll BE a great song writer, he's becoming a great song writer. And Robert writes REALLY interesting stuff.&quot;   
<li>&quot;This is it, this is our world tour, we'll have the black shirts that say 'World Tour: Conan O'Brien'.&quot;
<li>&quot;Ride to live. Relax and umm. . . Biggie Fries.&quot;   -Ben Folds' REAL Philosophy 
<li>&quot;We have a broken distortion pedal. This is a life or death situation, just like Robert getting a haircut.&quot;   -Ben Folds live at Lupo's
<li>&quot;You're gonna watch this shit, it's gonna look like a Godzilla film, 'cause it's jerky as hell, but that's okay.&quot;   Ben, singing about BFF's 'cybercasted' concert. 
<li>&quot;Whee-Hoo! Thank you kindly.&quot; 
<li>&quot;Alot of people assume that my name is Ben because I'm the guy who sings, and thats the name of the band, but it's kinda like Hootie and The Blowfish. My name's actually Quami.&quot; 
<li>&quot;That's Darren Jesse on the drumset, and Robert 'Yule' Sledge on the bass guitar and keyboard.&quot; 
<li>&quot;Every once and awhile straps break. Sorry about that Robert.&quot; 
<li>&quot;Has anybody here ever been hit by a car before?&quot;   
<li>&quot;Anyone here have a domestic dispute involving throwing plates?&quot; 
<li>&quot;I've never been hit by a car, or thrown a plate.&quot;   
<li>&quot;This song we're about to play delves into that somewhat, into the art of plate throwing, car driving and hitting, uh, being run over by cars...&quot; 
<li>&quot;It's been a long while, since I had a little cake. I want to eat cake every day.&quot;   
<li>&quot;Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay Robbie Rob's in the mother fuckin' house. Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay, the sounds of the bass bring me to another day. Play,   the mother fuckin' bass.&quot;

If so, please post them here.. :)         Posted by: dylan  7-14-2001, 1:37pm         &quot;I don't like 'Ben Folds Five' very much at all anymore.

But I think 'five' is much better than if we were called something serious like the 'Ben Folds Project' or some shit like that.&quot;   -Ben Folds     &quot;I think it's the perfect touring piano. I think I have like the greatest touring piano there ever was because it's the perfect length ... I've actually had tons of guys at clubs say, 'Well, we'll see how long you take that piano around.' I wanna fucking kick their ass for that, 'cause it's like, we moved that piano for two years by ourselves ... two guys in the band like hoisting it off a truck and playing it and to have someone flippantly walk by and go, 'Huh, we'll see how long you do that.' It's like, 'Fuck you.'&quot;   -Ben Folds     &quot;Nashville is a nice way to fail.&quot;   -Ben Folds     &quot;There were a lot of musicians around here I talked to [about starting a piano-bass-drums band] who couldn't see it.

Posted by: Jane Be Jane  7-15-2001, 7:13am         Here are a few more from Ben:     &quot;The songs that I wrote -- I didn't write all the songs -- but the songs that I wrote and the words I wrote were just what was basically on my mind, or what would sort of move me at that moment and then you put the record out and you're like, 'Oh shit, it's out there!'&quot; (On whether he was reluctant to put out Reinhold Messner, due to the more emotional, heartfelt nature)     &quot;The fastest song I ever wrote was one of the sincere songs on the last album. It was called &quot;Evaporated.&quot; Written in literally 15 minutes. As quickly as I could write it down and work the chords out.&quot;     &quot;I spent 8 years writing my songs and trying so hard to make a particular thing happen -- I wanted to put out a record.

JBJ     It was pain, sunny days and rain         Posted by: Slk24kgj  7-15-2001, 10:30am         I know this one isn't Ben Folds but its too good not to go up here, and also, I am sorry for not giving credit to the person who gave me this quote, I forgot where I got it from.     DAK   Doug Kaplan     &quot;Ben touched me very lightly on the shoulder, looked me in the eyes and said, 'What's up?' I said, 'Uh, not much.' Then his hand went down my back a little- more than I was comfortable with. He invited me over to watch movies- I thought. He started, basically, rubbing himself down with baby oil. I was really shocked, I didn't know what to do about it. So, I called up Robert...The rest is history.&quot; -Darren Jessee         Posted by: darthjustin  7-15-2001, 5:40pm         Here ya go:   &quot;When Ben plays the piano, he hits it very heard.&quot;   -Scotty Folds (Ben's Mom)     &quot;We'd like to thank Mr. Matthews and his band for letting us play for you here today.

(This quote was longer, it accidentally got cut down, and the meaning was lost, oops.)     &quot;This is it, this is our world tour, we'll have the black shirts that say 'World Tour: Conan O'Brien'.&quot;   Ben, talking about the extent of Fear Of Pop's live touring venue on Late Night With Conan O'Brien     There, sorry for the long post, again.

Wow! Another fan! Sorry, I just can't believe that something I made up in 2 hours in the middle of the night got so popular...   Not that I have a contest going with someone else for webpage hits but, uhh... spread the word!! Let's see that counter hit 3300!!!!! Whoo hoo!! :o)   And now... more quotes:     &quot;You're gonna watch this shit, it's gonna look like a Godzilla film, 'cause it's jerky as hell, but that's okay.&quot;   Ben, singing about BFF's 'cybercasted' concert.     &quot;Whee-Hoo! Thank you kindly.&quot;   Ben     &quot;Alot of people assume that my name is Ben because I'm the guy who sings, and thats the name of the band, but it's kinda like Hootie and The Blowfish. My name's actually Quami.&quot;   Ben     &quot;That's Darren Jesse on the drumset, and Robert 'Yule' Sledge on the bass guitar and keyboard.&quot;   Ben     &quot;Every once and awhile straps break. Sorry about that Robert.&quot;   Ben     &quot;Has anybody here ever been hit by a car before?&quot;   Ben     &quot;Anyone here have a domestic dispute involving throwing plates?&quot;   Ben     &quot;I've never been hit by a car, or thrown a plate.&quot;   Ben     &quot;This song we're about to play delves into that somewhat, into the art of plate throwing, car driving and hitting, uh, being run over by cars...&quot;   Ben, about the song Fair.     &quot;It's been a long while, since I had a little cake. I want to eat cake every day.&quot;   Ben, singing about cake.     &quot;Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay Robbie Rob's in the mother fuckin' house. Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay, the sounds of the bass bring me to another day. Play,   the mother fuckin' bass.&quot;   Ben, singing/rapping.     &quot;It seems as if you're good for makin' jokes about your jimmy well here's a jimmy joke about your mamma that you might not like.&quot;
<li>&quot;We did play a Metal bar and that fucking sucked.&quot;  
<li>&quot;I grew up right in the sticks with a bunch of kids soupin' up thier cars and stuff like that.&quot; 
<li>&quot;Hey! Hey! Hey quit fuckin' around I wanna rock, okay?&quot; 
<li>&quot;That's Snuzz over on the guitar, and that's my old friend Millard on the bass. And that's Jim on the drums. And, I'm, I'm Ben, and I'm nervous as shit.&quot; 
<li>&quot;Since I fucked that one up, maybe I should do another one.&quot; 
<li>&quot;It's kinda easy! He's a smart-ass!&quot;   - Robert, when asked how someone could not like Ben 
<li>&quot;He does put a mask on so you can't tell exactly who the people are in a certain song. If he does mention their name, he does it in reverse. People do like to hear their names in songs, and if it flies by and it's incriminating, they don't usually care.&quot; - Robert on Ben's songwriting 
<li>&quot;So, umm, I was thinking to myself sometime last year that I needed a hit song. So I listened to the radio for about a half hour and I shit this out. Wish me luck.&quot;     -Ben introducing &quot;Rockin the Suburbs&quot;
<li>&quot;It's a little known fact that the song we're about to play was actually written in 1887 by steven foster. If you didn't know, he was a short fella back in the wild west, and this song is called 'one angry dwarf and 200 solemn faces'.&quot;
<li>&quot;Yeah. I won't go to hell, I won't burn for what I've done on this record.&quot;   - Ben re recording in a church in Adelaide - the City of Churches 
<li>&quot;Oh yeah, they love it. They love the Weird Al video. They're two years old and they watched the video and looked at me with wide eyes � they were freaked out.&quot;  - Ben on whether his kids liked the video 
<li>&quot;Louis likes to shake his ass.&quot;   - Ben 
<li>&quot;We saw a lot of each other for six years, so we aren't rushing to do any barbecues anytime soon&quot;   Ben, referring to Darren and Robert.
<li>&quot;It's really nice, but it's hard, too&quot;   Ben, on playing all the instruments for the new album
<li>&quot;It was good for me to be away from everything. I was away from the business, business relating to the break-up of the band. All of that stuff didn't affect me. I was so isolated.&quot;   Ben, on recording in Adelaide, not N.C.   
<li>&quot;it's about making the suburban mass feel like the artsy fartsy&quot; ben on RTS 
<li>&quot;Thanks alot ya'll, we're the Spice Girls and we'll be back in March.&quot;   Ben
