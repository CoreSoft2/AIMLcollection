 <pattern>BEAUTIFUL AMERICA<TOPIC=FIVEIRONFRENZY></pattern>
 <template>The man on the television said I need to drink this,<br>  and sleep with that, in order to be cool.<br>  And you know that I would do almost anything, to be like that guy on TV. I know that if I had just the right outfit and a hairstyle that could be me. Don't you know you can't be cool if you dress dumb,<br>  I need to have that 'cause everybody's got one.<br>  I think I'll start smoking, that would make me intellectual,<br>  that's what I've always wanted to be.<br>  I need to lift weights, that would make me more sexual,<br>  and that would be good for me.<br>  In America it's wonderful, all you have to do is fake it.<br>  Own anything you want, all you have to do is take it.<br>  Live for today, don't think about tomorrow,<br>  have a good time in America-Gomorrah.<br>  What are you looking at, you better not make me mad.<br>  I'll drive by your house and shoot your dog, and mom, and dad.<br>  I don't need you or the Bible or anything to tell me what is the law.<br>  With a good enough lawyer I can do anything in Beautiful America.<br>  I want to be in America,<br>  Okay for me in America, everything's free in America,<br>  for a small fee in America.<br></template>

 <pattern>COOL ENOUGH FOR YOU<TOPIC=FIVEIRONFRENZY></pattern>
 <template>What could this be, too much MTV?<br>  Chalk another fad up for its fall into infamy.<br>  What�s in a standard if it changes all the time?<br>  You�re still having trouble in defining your own kind.<br>  Need I remind you, we all knew you before,<br>  you threw the rocks at the stage from your glass house on the floor?<br>  Now I think you�re punk, just because it�s in.<br>  You found a foul mouth and a couple safety pins.<br>  Got a peaceful feeling, I don�t want to fight no more.<br>  Got a peaceful feeling, I don�t care if we�re punk, or ska, or hardcore, enough for you, it�s sad but true,<br>  you can call us names till your face turns blue.<br>  Our assurance comes from God, it�s nothing new,<br>  we�ll never care �cause we�re never cool enough for you.<br>  That smug look on your face, your nose up in the air,<br>  your patches say you�re open-minded,<br>  but still you couldn�t bear,some punk thrown in with ska.<br>  You said it wouldn�t work. Well you can take your Vespa home<br>  �cause ska made you a jerk.<br>  The purist turns a deaf ear.<br>  He�s such an intellect,<br>  Does he think his censorship is gaining our respect?<br>  The raising of a fist, like a trigger of a gun.<br>  Stop and see we�re all alike, and we can dance as one.<br></template>
