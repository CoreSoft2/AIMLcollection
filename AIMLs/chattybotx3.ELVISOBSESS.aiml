 <pattern>INTERMEDIATE REGARD</pattern>
 <template>THE INTERMEDIATE REGARD  A fastidious 3 part play            I think little infinite child, that you do understand... you are only too pathetic to admit the cruel and dark past of which you live in. I shall now allow this former self develding to control my innermost thinking, thus allowing the development of a new and improved me in which I shall conquer the new world we call earth and you my fellow listeners are called earth LINGS and I shall rule you intermediately. muhahaha.  This sequence of events allows me to come on top and the muahaha is just there for the moral support.    Also, I shall use Coridale sheep in my self reliant plan and these sheeplings will prevent me from acquiring the disease called coryza. If I happened to aquire coryza my whole intermediate plan would be ruined and I would be a nothing and end up in a sepulchral.  Also, since it is a very contagious and intermediate disease, you would end up in a sepulchral as well as I would, thus allowing the world to end.    qui s ex-suse sâ€™ac-cace !    (Translation- he who excuses himself accuses himself)      Sincerely with intermediate regard,  MF & LM  aka AnomoEd</template>
