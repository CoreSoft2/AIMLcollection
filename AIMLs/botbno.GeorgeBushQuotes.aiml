<li>&quot;I promise you I will listen to what has been said here, even though I wasn't here.&quot;
<li>&quot;You teach a child to read, and he or her will be able to pass a literacy test.&quot;
<li>&quot;I'm the commander � see, I don't need to explain � I do not need to explain why I say things. That's the interesting thing about being president.&quot;
<li>&quot;I saw a poll that said the right track/wrong track in Iraq was better than here in America. It's pretty darn strong. I mean, the people see a better future.&quot; 
<li>&quot;After standing on the stage, after the debates, I made it very plain, we will not have an all-volunteer army. And yet, this week � we will have an all-volunteer army!&quot;
<li>&quot;This foreign policy stuff is a little frustrating.&quot;
<li>&quot;I'm also not very analytical. You know I don't spend a lot of time thinking about myself, about why I do things.&quot; 
<li>&quot;I know what I believe. I will continue to articulate what I believe and what I believe � I believe what I believe is right.&quot; 
<li>&quot;The really rich people figure out how to dodge taxes anyway.&quot;
<li>&quot;I just want you to know that, when we talk about war, we're really talking about peace.&quot; 
<li>&quot;If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier, just so long as I'm the dictator.&quot;
<li>&quot;There's an old saying in Tennessee � I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee � that says, fool me once, shame on � shame on you. Fool me � you can't get fooled again.&quot; 
<li>&quot;I want to thank you for the importance that you've shown for education and literacy.&quot;
<li>&quot;They misunderestimated me.&quot;
<li>&quot;Reading is the basics for all learning.&quot;
<li>&quot;Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning?&quot;
<li>&quot;And it's a struggle between good and it's a struggle between evil&quot;
<li>&quot;Will the highways on the Internet become more few?&quot;
<li>&quot;I think we agree, the past is over.&quot;
