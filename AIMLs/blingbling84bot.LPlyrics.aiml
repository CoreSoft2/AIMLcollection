 <pattern>A PLACE FOR MY HEAD</pattern>
 <template>A Place For My Head     I watch how the  Moon sits in the sky / in the dark night  Shining with the light from the sun  The sun doesn't give / light to the moon assuming  The moon�s going to owe it one  It makes me think of how you act to me / You do  Favors and then rapidly / You just  Turn around and start asking me / about  Things you want back from me  I�m sick of the tension / sick of the hunger  Sick of you acting like I owe you this  Find another place / to feed your greed  While I find a place to rest  I want to be in another place  I hate when you say you don�t understand  (You�ll see it's not meant to be)   I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy  A place for my head  Maybe someday I�ll be just like you / and  Step on people like you do and / Run  Away the people I thought I knew  I remember back then who you were  You used to be calm / used to be strong  Used to be generous / but you should�ve known / That you�d  Wear out your welcome / now you see  How quiet it is / all alone / I�m so  Sick of the tension / sick of the hunger  Sick of you acting like I owe you this  Find another place / to feed your greed  While / I find a place to rest / I�m so  Sick of the tension / sick of the hunger  Sick of you acting like I owe you this  Find another place / to feed your greed  While / I find a place to rest  I want to be in another place  I hate when you say you don�t understand  (You�ll see it's not meant to be)   I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy  A place for my head    You try to take the best of me  Go away  You try to take the best of me  Go away  You try to take the best of me  Go away  You try to take the best of me  Go away  You try to take the best of me  Go away  You try to take the best of me  Go away  You try to take the best of me  Go away  You try to take the best of me  Go away    I want to be in another place  I hate when you say you don�t understand  (You�ll see it's not meant to be)   I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy  A place for my head    Shut...up    I�m so sick of the tension / sick of the hunger  Sick of you acting like I owe you this  Find another place / to feed your greed  While I find a place to rest    I�m so sick of the tension / sick of the hunger  Sick of you acting like I owe you this  Find another place / to feed your greed  While I find a place to rest</template>

 <pattern>ITS GOING DOWN</pattern>
 <template>It's Going Down (Featuring Linkin Park)     I knew I was being threatened  Do you think it�s worth holding out?   I mean I�ve heard some pretty ugly things about those guys  Ugly stories  Watch them flee  Watch them flee  Rap up  Watch them flee  Hip-Hop hits  And you do it like this    It�s going down  The rhythm projects �round the next sound  Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now  Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down  The melting pot of a super-futureesque style  The combination of a vocal caress  With lungs that gasp for breath  From emotional stress  With special effects  And a distorted collage  Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage    It�s going down  The logical progression on a the timeline  The separation narrowed down to a fine line  To blur the edges so they blend together properly  Take you on an audible odyssey  Now it�s going down  A logical progression on the timeline  The separation narrowed down to a fine line  To blur the edges so they blend together properly  Take u on a an audible odyssey  Now it�s going down  Put put put it up  It said it goes like this  And you do it like this  It�s going down  Put put it up  It said it go- go- goes like this  And you do it like this  Its going down  Once again it is  Composed sentences all together venomous  The four elements of natural force  Projected daily through the sound of the source  Everybody on board with this blend  The sword with the pen  The mightiest is the weapons  Swinging right from the chin  The elevate of mental states  Long gone with the wind  To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends  It�s going down  Stalence emulation readily  Trekking through the weaponry  Of the pure pedigree  Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me  Whatever the weather be  We invent the steadily  It�s going down to sub-terrestrial high  I rhyme regiment that�s calling the shots  Execution of collaborative plots  Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop    It�s going down  A logical progression on a the timeline  The separation narrowed down to a fine line  To blur the edges so they blend together properly  Take you on an audible odyssey  Now, it�s going down    Put put put it up  It said it goes like this  And you do it like this  It�s going down  Put put it up  It said it goes like this  And you do it like this    It�s going down  X-men �bout to blast of world wide  Yo it�s request only  X- men �bout to blast of world wide  It�s built from scratch  Album in stores soon  �Bout to blast off world wide  And you do it like this    It�s going down  Put put put it up  It said it goes like this  And you do it like this  It�s going down  Put put it up  It said it goes like this  And you do it like this  It�s going down  Like this...</template>

 <pattern>ONE STEP CLOSER</pattern>
 <template>One Step Closer     I cannot take this anymore  I'm saying everything I've said before  All these words they make no sense  I find bliss in ignorance  Less I hear the less you'll say  But you'll find that out anyway  Just like before...     Everything you say to me  Takes me one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break  I need a little room to breathe  Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break    I find the answers aren't so clear  Wish I could find a way to disappear  All these thoughts they make no sense  I find bliss in ignorance  Nothing seems to go away  Over and over again  Just like before...     Everything you say to me  Takes me one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break  I need a little room to breathe  Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break  Everything you say to me  Takes me one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break  I need a little room to breathe  Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break  Break break break break break    shut up when I'm talking to you  shut up shut up shut up   shut up when I'm talking to you  shut up shut up shut up shut up  I�m about to break    Everything you say to me  Takes me one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break  I need a little room to breathe  Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break  Everything you say to me  Takes me one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break  I need a little room to breathe  Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break  break  I need a little room to breathe  Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break  Break break break break break break    shut up when I'm talking to you  shut up shut up shut up   shut up when I'm talking to you  shut up shut up shut up shut up  I�m about to break    Everything you say to me  Takes me one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break  I need a little room to breathe  Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break  Everything you say to me  Takes me one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break  I need a little room to breathe  Cause I'm one step closer to the edge  And I'm about to break</template>
