 <pattern>WHAT IS A KILLSWITCH</pattern>
 <template>Majestic 12, having operatives within The US government, FEMA, and UNATCO, were well aware of the potential for their more advanced agents to turn against them with devastating results.  This in mind, MJ12 made certain to include special methods of self-destruction in all of their augmented agents.  Models relying on mechanical replacements for biological components, or mechs, used &quot;kill phrases&quot; that instantaneously activated a large explosive charge on use.  The later, and more advanced units (using nanoaugmentation) used remote-activated &quot;killswitches&quot; which rendered an agent dead within twenty-four hours.</template>
