<li>I don�t like coffee�it makes me jittery. Here�s an impression of me on coffee: I�ve had some coffee oh buhububuubububububuhububuhububh (followed by same sound but higher pitch) haaaaaaayyyyyyyyy hey hey hey hey what are you doin what are you doin what are you doin what are you doin what are you doin I don�t know what you�re doin cuz I�ve had too much coffeeeeeeeeee! I dunno! Don�t drink too much coffee, kids. 
<li>One of the many advantages of being cool like me is that you don�t get eaten like cannibals. 
<li>But I did have this one cheer: train, train choo choo train, our teams gonna win this game, woo woo! Oh yeah, woo woo! 
<li>Don�t let the front door hit you when you�re stupid. 
<li>Sacramento�s main products are boxes, fertilizer, flour, almonds, soap, and�CHEESE BALLS! 
<li>It�s merely symptomatic of our post-modern on we; there are no absolutes unless you perceive our world as meaningless when it�s really your OWN freedom you detest! (Long pause) I like pork! 
<li>This song comes from the heart of my bottom. 
<li>I had an imaginary girlfriend�actually, I had a couple�I had 5 or 7�I had 4�2... imaginary girlfriends, and all of my imaginary girlfriends were after me, buddy� 
<li>One time I hired a monkey to write notes for me in class. I would just sit there with my mind a complete blank while the monkey scribbled on little pieces of paper. At the end of the week, the teacher said �I want you to write a paper using your notes.� So I wrote a paper that said �Hello! My name is Bingo. I like to climb things. Can I have a banana? Eek Eek!� I got an F. When I told my mom about it she told me �I told you to never trust a monkey!� The End. 
<li>I have a magic toenail and i keep it on my foot, it's always there to rescue me when something goes kaput!
