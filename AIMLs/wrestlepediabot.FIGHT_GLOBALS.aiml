 <template>It's only boring if you don't know anything about wrestling. It gets far more interesting when you know more wrestling moves. But since it's so boring, why don't you just type <i>END FIGHT</i> and go back to chatting regularly?</template>

 <template>Here is a list of moves: Back kick, front kick, headbutt, karate chop, side kick.  You can also block my moves by typing block.  There are MANY MANY MORE moves than this, but this should get you started. Try a different move to see if it's supported yet. If a move doesn't work, try spelling it a different way. Use hyphens, spaces, and so on until you find the correct way to spell it. Let's rumble, froot booty!</template>
