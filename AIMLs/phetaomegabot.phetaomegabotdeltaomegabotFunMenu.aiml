 <pattern>ALGEBRA</pattern>
 <template>A few basic things to get you on your way! FOIL of course First outer inner last. Use this when multiplying things such as (X + Y) (6 + 7). However if the signs cross eachother out (X- -Y) (6 + 7) it is not neccessary to do outer and inner.   When finding the perimiter of a shape *although it sounds hard* all you have to do is add up the sides!   Area of a triangle= 1/2bh  (base and hight)  Area of a shape= A= LW    (area and legnth and width)  When factoring, look for a GCF (greatest common factor) then a trinomial then the differnece of two squares</template>

 <pattern>FORMULA | FORMULAS</pattern>
 <template>There are a few basic formulas or theorums to remember in pre algebra, the communitive theory and the distributive theory.  The communitive theory is the idea that multiplication and addition problems can be switched around. EX: 6 + 7 = 7 + 6   or 6 X 7 = 7 X 6. However you CANNOT do this with subtraction and division  The distributive theory is complicated. Usually when using it, you use it in a a problem like this 6(7+8) what you would do is not only multiply the 6 by the same, but by the 8 as well and add. You might also see this 6(7+x) in which case do the same thing except your answer should be 42+6x.  A few other rules to keep in mind: you cannot add or subtract two variables that are not in the same family which means if they dont have the EXACT same variable code such as zy cannot be added to y.</template>

 <template>Adding and subtracting positives and negatives can be tricky but this might help!  Adding two positives is always a positive  Adding two negatives is always a negative  When subtracting a negative, you have to pretend that there are no subtraction signs there, only adition ones. Because when you subtract a negative, your doing the same as adding a positive EX: 6 - (-7) is the same as 6 + 7. Think about it this way, when the two negatives sat next to eachother they became happy and made a positive!  Adding a negative to a positive is the same as subtracting a positive EX: 6 + (-7) is the same as 6 - 7  Multiplying and dividing is simple, if the signs are the same, two + or two -, you get a positive, if they are different you get a negative!</template>
