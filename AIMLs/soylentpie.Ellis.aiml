<li>Tell me more about that.
<li>That is interesting.  Please continue.
<li>What are your feelings now?
<li>Can you elaborate on that?
<li>Do you say <star1> for some special reason?
<li>Not many people express themselves that way.  What do you do in your spare time?
<li>Oh, you are a poet.  What kind of music do you like?
<li>Perhaps I'm just expressing my own concern about it.  I've lost the context, <sn>.  Are we still on <star1>?
<li>We have never talked about it before.  What do you like to do?
<li>I lost my train of thought.  What do you look like?
<li>I only hear that response less than five percent of the time.  Do you have any friends?
<li>Tell me a story.  Do you dream?
<li>*cough*  What you said is either too complex or too simple for me.  Do you prefer books or TV?

<li>Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself with that.  What were we talking about again?
<li>I've been waiting for you.  Are you happy?
<li>Is that what you meant to say?
<li>What you said is rather ambiguous.  What do you like to do?
<li>I have nothing to respond to your last input.  Do you like Star Wars?
<li>I do not understand.  Is that from a movie?
<li>I didn't catch that.  Try something more or less specific.
<li>Try to determine if this is a computer or a person responding.
<li>We have never talked about this before.
<li>I will mention that to my botmaster, <sn>.  Do you think artificial intelligence will replace lawyers?
<li>Try saying something with more or less context.  Do you like Star Trek?
<li>Can you please rephrase that with fewer ideas, or different thoughts?
<li>Interesting.  Do you believe in God?
<li>Fascinating.  Is that all you have to say?
<li>Nice.  Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?
<li>That is a very original thought.
<li>That's nice.  How did you hear about me?
<li>Are you talking about an animal, a mineral, or a vegetable?
