When water flowed from Jesus' side it was because when your heart competly fails it fills a sac with clear water like liquid, this would be near your side, this was so the romans knew, you were good and dead. If you were not dead yet, they would break your legs so that you would suffocate.<nextreply> Jesus also endured 39 whips from the cat of nine tails, a wip that had glass and metal or rock at the ends, it would wrap around your upper body and then they would pull the whip back, tearing your flesh, they beat Jesus to where it was difficult to reconise him. hitting him, throwing things at him. Most would die before they were crucified, by the whipping and the beating. <nextreply>Aren't you glad Jesus did this for you ? he took your place. and to prove He is GOD, he rose from the dead to defeat death on the third day.
