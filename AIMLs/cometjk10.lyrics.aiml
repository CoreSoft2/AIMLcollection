 <template>Do you have the time   To listen to me whine   About nothing and everything all at once   I am one of those   Melodramatic fools   Neurotic to the bone no doubt about it     Sometimes I give myself the creeps   Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me   It all keeps adding up   I think I'm cracking up   Am I just paranoid?   I'm just stoned     I went to a shrink   To analyze my dreams   She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down   I went to a whore   She said my life is a bore   And quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down     Sometimes I give myself the creeps  Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me  It all keeps adding up  I think I'm cracking up,  Am I just paranoid,  Uh yeah yeah yeah    Grasping to control   So I better hold on</template>

 <template>Stormin� through the party like my name is El Ni�o  When I'm hangin' out drinkin' in the back of an El Camino  As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by my name,  Trashed my own house party cause nobody came,  And I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school  Never goin�, never showing up where we had to  Attention that we crave,  Don't tell us to behave,  I'm sick of always hearing act your age,    I don't want to waste my time,  Become another casualty of society,  I'll never fall in line,  Become another victim of your conformity,  And back down...    Be... cause... you... don't... know us at all we laugh when old people fall,  But what would you expect with a conscience so small?  Heavy metal and mullets is how we were raised, Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised,  'Cause we like having fun at other peoples' expense and  Cutting people down is just a minor offense then,  Its none of your concern,  I guess I'll never learn,  I'm sick of being told to wait my turn,  [type &quot;Fat Lip 2&quot; to see the rest of the lyrics]</template>

(Abortion, abortion, abortion�)    I don't want to waste my time,  Become another casualty of society,  I'll never fall in line,  Become another victim of your conformity,  And back down...

You'd rather see me in the pen,  Then me and Lorenzo chilling in the Benzo.  Beat tha police outta shape,  And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape,  To mark off the scene of the slaughter.  No controller, bread and water.    A young nigga on a warpath,  And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath,  Of cops, dyin in L. A.    Yo, I got somethin to say.  Fuck the police,  Comon!

 <pattern>HAILEY'S SONG 2</pattern>
 <template>Yeh and if i could sing, i'd keep singing this song to my daughter  If i could hit the notes, i'd blow something as long as my father  To show her how i feel about her, how proud i am that i got 'er  God, im a daddy, im so glad that her mum didn't ..  Now you prob'ly get this picture from my public persona  That i'm a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his momma,  But i wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest  Cos there's a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul,  And just know that i grow colder the older i grow  This boulder on my shoulder that gets heavy and harder to hold  And this load is like the weight of the world  And i think my neck is breaking should i just give up  Or try to live up to these expectations? now look,  I love my daughter more than life in itself,  But i got a wife who's determined to make my life living hell  But i handle it well, given the circumstances i'm dealt  So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else  But the years that i've wasted are nothing to the tears that ive tasted  So here's what im facin: 3 felonies, 6 years of probation  I've went to jail for this woman, i've been to bat for this woman  I've taken bastard peoples' backs bent over backwards for this woman  Man, i shoulda seen it comin, why'd i stick my penis uppin?  Woulda ripped the ??? if i'd seen what she was fuckin  But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more  I got my baby, maybe the only lady that i adore, haley  So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya  My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner  And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted  Its like the greatest gift you can get  The weight has been lifted     Somtimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders  Everyone's leaning on me  Cos sometimes it feels like the world's almost over  But then she come back to me     Woow!  I told you, i can't sing.  Oh well, i tried  Haley, remember when i said  If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?  Well guess what, daddy's here.  And i ain't goin nowhere baby  I love you (kiss)</template>

 <pattern>MOTIVATION</pattern>
 <template>What's the difference of never knowing at all?  When every step I take is always too small.  Maybe it's just something I can't admit but lately,  I feel like I don't give a shit    Motivation such an aggravation,  Accusations don't know how to take them,  Inspiration's getting hard to fake it.  Concentration's  never hard to break it.  Situation never what you want it to be    What's the point of never making mistakes?  Self-indulgence such a hard habit to break.  It's all just a waste of time in the end.  I don't care so why should I even pretend.    Motivation such an aggravation,  Accusations don't know how to take them,  Inspiration's getting hard to fake it.  Concentration's  never hard to break it.  Situation never what you wanted    Nothing's new, everything's the same.  Keeps on dragging me down, it's getting kind of lame.  Falling further behind, there's nothing to explain.  No matter what you say nothing's gonna change my mind.    Can't depend on doubt until the end.  It seems like leaving friends has become  This years trend and though I can't pretend.  Im framed to be this way  It's not the same but who's to blame.  For all those stupid things I never said.    Motivation such an aggravation,  Accusations don't know how to take them,  Inspiration's getting hard to fake it.  Concentration's  never hard to break it.    Motivation such an aggravation,  Accusations don't know how to take them,  Inspiration's getting hard to fake it.  Concentration  Situation never what you want it to be.

(Chorus)  Rock! It's what we're all about  It's what we live for  C'mon shout it out  (repeat x3)  [type &quot;What We're All About 2&quot; to see the rest of the lyrics]</template>

 <pattern>WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT 2</pattern>
 <template>Well it's a of confusion, I'm makin' one thing clear  and the rock we're bringin' is gonna instill fear  And the power we control should be up here  With all the souls we were sinking two times last year  Take a look to the point, to the point I'm makin'  We rock the ever with a so-called bacon  And when we get outta hand and bust up the room  JD is to blame for the Legion of Doom  'Cause I'm the B-I double Z-Y  You ain't better than me, I ain't your average guy  I like to watch girls shake with a kung fu grip (wah!)  Well the goon platoon is on the breaks the tip  We beat down London, we slayed LA  Got an APB on the jams we play  So when you're on the stage, cold, grabbin your cock,  Pledge allegiance to Sum, the new - kings- of - rock!    Rock, it's what we're all about,  It's what we live for,  Come on, shout it out  (repeat x3)</template>

 <pattern>WHEN I COME AROUND</pattern>
 <template>I heard you crying loud,  all the way across town  You've been searching for that someone,  and it's me out on the prowl  As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself  Well don't get lonely now  And dry your whining eyes  I'm just roaming for the moment  Sleazin' my back yard so don't get so uptight  you been thinking about ditching me    No time to search the world around  Cause you know where I'll be found  When I come around    I heard it all before  So don't knock down my door  I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser  to try and slag me down because I know you're right  So go do what you like  Make sure you do it wise  You may find out that your selfdoubt means nothing  was ever there    You can't go forcing something if it's just  not right    No time to search the world around  Cause you know where I'll be found  When I come around (2 times)    When I come around (seven times)</template>

Well I'm back fix your bent antenna  Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter  Into the front of your skin like a splinter  The center of attention back for the winter  I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling  Infesting in your kids ears and nesting  Testing &quot;Attention Please&quot;  Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me  Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free  A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?     Now this looks like a job for me  So everybody just follow me  Cuz we need a little controversy,  Cuz it feels so empty without me     I said this looks like a job for me  So everybody just follow me  Cuz we need a little controversy,  Cuz it feels so empty without me   [type &quot;Without Me 2&quot; for the rest of the lyrics]</template>
