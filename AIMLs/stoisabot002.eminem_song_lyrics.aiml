 <pattern>CLEANING OUT MY CLOSET</pattern>
 <template>Lyrics    Album: The Eminem Show (2002)  Song: Cleaning Out My Closet    Verse 1  Have you ever been hated or discriminated against? I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against  P icket signs for my wicked rhymes. Look at the times. Sick is the mind of the motha fuckin' kid that's behind  all this commotion. Emotions run deep as ocean's explodin.' Tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin.'  Not takin 'nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin.' Keep kickin' ass in the mornin,' an' takin' names in the evening.  Leavem with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth. See, they can trigger me but they never figure me out  Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now. Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now.     Chorus (2X)  I'm sorry, Mama. I never meant to hurt you. I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet.     Verse 2  I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it. So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it,  I'ma expose it. I'll take you back to 73 before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD.   I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months. My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch,   cuz he split. I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye. No, I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die.   look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side. Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try   to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake. I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human. But I'm man enough to face them today.  What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun.  Cuz id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot Kim an' him both. It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show.     Chorus (2X)    Verse 3  Now I would never dis my own mama just to get recognition. Take a second to listen for you think this record is dissin'  But put yourself in my position. Just try to envision witnessin' your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen,  bitchin' that someone's always goin' throuh her purse and shits missin'. Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome.  My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew up, now I blew up. It makes you sick to ya stomach,  doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?  But guess what, yer gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely. An' Nathan's getting' up so quick, he's gonna know that your phoney.  And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful. But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral.  See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong. Bitch, do ya song. Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom.  But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get. You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit.  Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well, guess what, I am dead. Dead to you as can be.     Chorus (4X)</template>

 <pattern>CRIMINAL</pattern>
 <template>Lyrics    Album: Marshall Mathers LP (2000)  Song: Criminal    [Eminem]  A lot of people ask me.. stupid fuckin questions  A lot of people think that.. what I say on records  or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life  or that I believe in it  Or if I say that, I wanna kill somebody, that..   I'm actually gonna do it  or that I believe in it  Well, shit.. if you believe that  then I'll kill you  You know why?  Cuz I'm a    CRIMINAL  CRIMINAL  You god damn right  I'm a CRIMINAL  Yeah, I'm a CRIMINAL    [Eminem]  My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge  That'll stab you in the head  whether you're a fag or lez  Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest  Pants or dress - hate fags? The answer's &quot;yes&quot;  Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic  Starin at my jeans, watchin my genitals bulgin (Ooh!)  That's my motherfuckin balls, you'd better let go of em  They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of em  Hey, it's me, Versace  Whoops, somebody shot me!  And I was just checkin the mail  Get it? Checkin the 'male'?  How many records you expectin to sell  after your second LP sends you directly to jail?  C'mon!-- Relax guy, I like gay men  Right, Ken? Give me an amen (AAA-men!)  Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus  Heal this child, help us destroy these demons  Oh, and please send me a brand new car  And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital  Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher  You can't reach me, my mom can't neither  You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause  I watch TV, and Comcast cable  and you ain't able to stop these thoughts  You can't stop me from toppin these charts  And you can't stop me from droppin each March  with a brand new cd for these fuckin retards  Duhhh, and to think, it's just little ol' me  Mr. &quot;Don't Give A Fuck,&quot; still won't leave    Chorus: Eminem (repeat 2X)    I'm a CRIMINAL  Cuz every time I write a rhyme, these people think it's a crime  to tell em what's on my mind - I guess I'm a CRIMINAL  but I don't gotta say a word, I just flip em the bird  and keep goin, I don't take shit from no one    [Eminem]  My mother did drugs - tar, liquor, cigarettes, and speed  The baby came out - disfigured, ligaments indeed  It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she  Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me  I'm a CRIMINAL - an animal caged who turned crazed  But how the fuck you sposed to grow up when you weren't raised?  So as I got older and I got a lot taller  My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger  I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker  than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin the word ...  My morals went thhbbpp when the president got oral  Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk  Off of his own employee  Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me  You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired  and my nose is pointy  I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die  in plane crashes and laughs  As long as it ain't happened to him  Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em  -inem and Kim combined - *kch* the maniac's in  Replacin the doctor cause Dre couldn't make it today  He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin his place  (Mm-mm-mmm!) Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face  Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place  I told you Dre, you should've kept that thang put away  I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?  I'm a CRIMINAL    [Interlude Skit]  Aight look (uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker  get the motherfuckin money and get the fuck up outta there  [Em] Aight  I'll be right here waitin on you  [Em] Aight  Yo Em  [Em] What?!  Don't kill nobody this time  [Em] Awwright... god damn, fuck...  (whistling) how you doin'?  [Teller] HI, how can I help you?  [Eminem] Yeah I need to make a withdrawl  [Teller] Okay  [Eminem] Put the fuckin money in the bag bitch  and I won't kill you!  [Teller] What? Oh my god, don't kill me  [Eminem] I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin around...  [Teller] Don't kill me, please don't kill me...  [Eminem] I said I'm not gonna fuckin kill you  Hurry the fuck up! {*BOOM*} Thank you!    [Eminem]  Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it  So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it  So I'll be disguised in it  And if anybody identifies the guy in it  I'll hide for five minutes  Come back, shoot the eyewitness  Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business  Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets  This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet  If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts  tuck my dick inbetween my legs and cluck  You motherfuckin chickens ain't brave enough  to say the stuff I say, so this tape is shut  Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up  To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass  And if it's not a rapper that I make it as  I'ma be a fuckin rapist in a Jason mask    (Chorus 2X)</template>

 <pattern>HAILIES SONG</pattern>
 <template>Lyrics    Album: The Eminem Show (2002)  Song: Hailie's Song    Intro  Yo I can't sing�but I feel like singing. I want to fuckin' sing�cuz I'm happy�yea�I'm happy. I got my baby back�yo�check it out...     Verse 1  Somedays I sit staring out the window, watchin' this world pass me by  Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for. I almost break down and cry.  Sometimes I think I'm crazy. I'm crazy, oh so crazy. Why am I here? Am I just wasting my time  But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy. It all makes sense when I look into her eyes     Chorus  Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders. Everyone's leaning on me  Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over, but then she comes back to me.     Verse 2  My baby girl keeps getting' older. I watch her grow up with pride.  People make jokes cuz they don't understand me, they just don't see my real side  I act like shit don't phase me, inside it drives me crazy. My insecurities could eat me alive  But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy. It all makes sense when I look in her eyes.     Verse 3  Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter. If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father  to show her how I feel about her. How proud I am that I got her. God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *censored* (want her)  Now you probably get this picture from my public persona that I'ma pistol packin' drug addict who bags on his mama.  But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest, cuz there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside  of my soul. And just know that I grow colder the older I grow. This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold,  and this load is like the weight of the world, and I think my neck is breakin'. Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?  Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself, but I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell.   But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt. So many chances, man, it's too bad - could have had someone else  But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted, so here's what I'm facin'�3 felonies, 6 years of probation.   I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman. I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman.  Man, I should have seen it coming. What did I stick my penis up in? Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin.'  But fuck it, it's over. There's no more reason to cry no more. I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore  (Hailie). So sayonara, try tommorra, nice to know ya. Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner.  And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted. It's like the greatest gift you could get. The weight has been lifted.     Chorus    Outro  Told you I can't sing..Oh well... I tried... Hailie, remember when I said if you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there? Guess what? Daddy's here, and I ain't going nowhere, baby. I love you�(kiss)</template>

And Dr. Dre said, &quot;Slim Shady you a basehead!&quot;  Uh-uhhh! &quot;So why's your face red? Man you wasted!&quot;  Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else  Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt  Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off  And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross  I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass  faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast  C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)  I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!    Chorus    [Eminem]  My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high  Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five  I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler  and stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Owwwwwwww!)  Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up  Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup  Extraterrestrial, runnin over pedestrians  in a spaceship while they screamin at me: &quot;LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!&quot;  Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to  I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)  I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper  Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)  You know you blew up when the women rush your stands  and try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans (Aaahhhhhh!)  This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph  (Dude, can I get your autograph?)  So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE!'    Chorus    [Eminem]  Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)  Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE!  I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)  I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive  (Huh yup!) Am I comin or goin? I can barely decide  I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive? (Go ahead)  All my life I was very deprived  I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide  (Whoops!) Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (hachhh-too)  I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)  When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits  HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM? (WAH!)  YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS! (WAHHH!)  I lay awake and strap myself in the bed   Put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (BANG!)  I'm steamin mad (Arrrggghhh!)

Man how's your daughter?  My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father  If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?  I'ma name her Bonnie  I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry  I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him  I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan  I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam  I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man  I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat  Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,  just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan  This is Stan    {Chorus: Dido}    [Eminem as 'Stan']  Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance  I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans  If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert  you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew  That's my little brother man, he's only six years old  We waited in the blistering cold for you,  four hours and you just said, &quot;No.&quot;  That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol  He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do  I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to  Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you  you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way  I never knew my father neither;  he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her  I can relate to what you're saying in your songs  so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on  cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed  I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest  Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds  It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me  See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it  My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7  But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does  She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up  You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose  Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.  We should be together too    {Chorus: Dido}    [Eminem as 'Stan']  Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,  this'll be the last package I ever send your ass  It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?  I know you got my last two letters;  I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect  So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it  I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway  Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?  You know the song by Phil Collins, &quot;In the Air of the Night&quot;  about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning  but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?  That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning  Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy  and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call  I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall  I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it  You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it  And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it  I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me  See Slim; {*screaming*} Shut up bitch! I'm tryin to talk!  Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk  but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you  cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too  Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now  Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?  {*car tires squeal*} {*CRASH*}  .. {*brief silence*} .. {*LOUD splash*}    {Chorus: Dido}    [Eminem]  Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy  You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?  Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that  and here's an autograph for your brother,  I wrote it on the Starter cap  I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you  Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you  But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?  I say that shit just clownin dogg,  c'mon - how fucked up is you?  You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling  to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some  And what's this shit about us meant to be together?  That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other  I really think you and your girlfriend need each other  or maybe you just need to treat her better  I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time  before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine  if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan  why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan  I just don't want you to do some crazy shit  I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick  Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge  and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid  and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to  Come to think about, his name was.. it was you  Damn!</template>

 <pattern>THE KIDS</pattern>
 <template>Lyrics    Album: Marshall Mathers LP (2000)  Song: The Kids    (Teacher Sings)  And everyone should get along..    Ok children quiet down, quiet down  Children i'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day  His name is Mr. Shady  Children quite down please  Brian don't throw that.. (SHUT UP!)  Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with ammonia  (HE'S GOT AIDS!)  Good luck Mr. Shady...    (Verse 1-Eminem)  Hi there little boys and girls (FUCK YOU!)  Today we're going to learn how to poision some squirrels  But first, i'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)  Say Hi Bob, (&quot;Hi Bob&quot;)  Bob's 30 and still lives with his Mom and he don't got a job  Cause Bob just sits at home and smokes pot  But his 12 year old brother looks up to him off alot  And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot  And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock  When it's late and the lot gets dark and he fakes like he walks his dog  Drag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the choppin' block  And even if they escape and they got the cops  Ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge  Till one night Miss. Stacey went off the job  When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk  But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off  But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy, a off his rocker  Crazier than Slim Shady is off the locker  You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor  He grabbed Stace by the legs, he chopped it off her  And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her  But ever since the day Stacey went off the wander  They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner  And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana  And what it might do to you  So see if the squirrels want it, it's bad for you       (Chorus)  See children, drugs are bad  And If you don't believe me, ask ya Dad  And If you don't believe him, ask ya Mom   She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time    So kids say no to drugs  So you don't act like everyone else does  And there's really nothing else to say  Drugs are just bad mmm k...      (Verse 2-Eminem)  My penis is the size of a peanut, Have you seen it?   Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?)  Speaking of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?  Ecstasy its the worst drug in the world  If someone offers it to you, don't do it  Kids 2 hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid  Cause spinal fluid is fine, you won't get it back  So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in ya back  Meet Zack, 21 years old   After hanging around with some friends at a Frat party  He gets bold, and decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys  And peer pressure will win when everytime you try to fight it  Suddenly, he starts to convulse   And his pulse goes into hyperdrive, and his eyes go back in his skull   His back starts ta...look like the McDonald's Arches  He's on Donald's carpet, laying horizontal barfin'  And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him  &quot;Hey Adam, Zack is a jackass, look at him&quot;  Cause they took it to, so they think it's funny  So the laughin' does basically nothing  Except maybe wastin' your money  Meanwhile, Zack's in a coma, the action is over  And his back and his shoulders, hunched up as if he was practicin' Yoha  And that's the story of Zack, the ecstasy maniac  So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you    (Repeat chorus)    (Verse 3-Eminem)  Last but not least,  One of the most humungous problems among young people today, is fungus  It grows from cow manure, They pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up,   and you put it right in ya mouth and chew it...Yum Yum  Then you start to see some dumb stuff  And everything slows down when you eat some, of um...  And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?)  Like fat woman in g-strings with orange hair  (Mr. Shady what's a g-string?)  It's yarn Claire  Women stick them up there behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)  And if you swallow too much of the magic mushroom  Whoops, did i say magic mushroom, i meant fungus  Ya tongue gets all swolled up like a cow's tongue (How come?)  Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Oh)  See drugs are bad, it's a common fact  Wit ya Mom and Dad, well that's all i'm good at (Ert)  But don't be me, cause if ya grow up and ya go OD  They're gonna come for me and i'mma have to grow a goatee  And get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault  So don't do drugs, and do exactly as i don't, cause it's bad for you    (Repeat chorus)    (Teacher & Classmates)  Come on children, clap along (SHUT UP!)  Sing along children (SUCK MY MOTHERFUCKING DICK!)  Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (SOUTHPARK GONNA SUE ME)  So don't do drugs, tell 'em save more for me (GOD DAMNIT! MUSHROOMS KILLED   KENNY)  (Pltttt OOOO *fart noises*)  la la la la!</template>

 <pattern>THE REAL SLIM SHADY</pattern>
 <template>Lyrics    Album: Marshall Mathers LP (2000)  Song: The Real Slim Shady    [Eminem]  May I have your attention please?  May I have your attention please?  Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?  I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?  We're gonna have a problem here..    Y'all act like you never seen a white person before  Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door  and started whoopin her ass worse than before  they first were divorce, throwin her over furniture (Ahh!)  It's the return of the... &quot;Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding,   he didn't just say what I think he did, did he?&quot;  And Dr. Dre said... nothing you idiots!   Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)  Feminist women love Eminem {*vocal turntable:   chigga chigga chigga*} &quot;Slim Shady, I'm sick of him  Look at him, walkin around grabbin his you-know-what  Flippin the you-know-who,&quot; &quot;Yeah, but he's so cute though!&quot;  Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose  But no worse, than what's goin on in your parents' bedrooms  Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't  but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose  &quot;My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips&quot;  And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss  And that's the message that we deliver to little kids  And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is  Of course they gonna know what intercourse is  By the time they hit fourth grade  They got the Discovery Channel don't they?  &quot;We ain't nothing but mammals..&quot; Well, some of us cannibals  who cut other people open like cantaloupes {*SLURP*}  But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes  then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope  {*EWWW!*} But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote  Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes    Chorus: Eminem (repeat 2X)    I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady  All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating  So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,  please stand up, please stand up?    [Eminem]  Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records;  well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!  You think I give a damn about a Grammy?  Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me  &quot;But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?&quot;  Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?  So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?  Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs  so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst  and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first  You little bitch, put me on blast on MTV  &quot;Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!&quot;  I should download her audio on MP3   and show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD {*AHHH!*}  I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me  so I have been sent here to destroy you {*bzzzt*}  And there's a million of us just like me  who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me  who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me  and just might be the next best thing but not quite me!    Chorus    [Eminem]  I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin you   things you joke about with your friends inside your living room  The only difference is I got the balls to say it  in front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all  I just get on the mic and spit it   and whether you like to admit it {*ERR*} I just shit it  better than ninety percent of you rappers out can  Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums  It's funny; cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty  I'll be the only person in the nursin home flirting  Pinchin nurses asses when I'm jackin off with Jergens  And I'm jerkin but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working  And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin  He could be workin at Burger King, spittin on your onion rings  {*HACH*} Or in the parkin lot, circling  Screaming &quot;I don't give a fuck!&quot;   with his windows down and his system up  So, will the real Shady please stand up?  And put one of those fingers on each hand up?  And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control  and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?    Chorus 2X    [Eminem]  Ha ha  Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us  Fuck it, let's all stand up</template>

 <pattern>THE WAY I AM</pattern>
 <template>Lyrics    Album: Marshall Mathers LP (2000)  Song: The Way I am    [Eminem]  Whatever..  Dre, just let it run  Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit  Aiyyo.. this song is for anyone.. fuck it   Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..    I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag  of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be  the most meanest MC on this -- on this Earth  And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse  And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works  And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve  all this tension dispensin these sentences  Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest  and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..  but at least have the decency in you  to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out   in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter  to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..  I don't know you and no,   I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing  I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think  I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick  if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..  No patience is in me and if you offend me   I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air   I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you  Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit  I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe  I'm tired of all you (of all you)..  I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me    Chorus: Eminem    And I am, whatever you say I am  If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?  In the paper, the news everyday I am  Radio won't even play my jam  Cause I am, whatever you say I am  If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?  In the paper, the news everyday I am  I don't know it's just the way I am    [Eminem]  Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered  with all of this nonsense it's constant  And, &quot;Oh, it's his lyrical content -  - the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses&quot;  And all of this controversy circles me  and it seems like the media immediately  points a finger at me (finger at me)..  So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie  or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up  when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up  with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too  When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school  and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin  Where were the parents at? And look where it's at  Middle America, now it's a tragedy  Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty  havin this happenin (this happenin)..  then attack Eminem cause I rap this way (rap this way)..  But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire   to burn and it's burnin and I have returned    Chorus    [Eminem]  I'm so sick and tired of bein admired  that I wish that I would just die or get fired  and dropped from my label and stop with the fables  I'm not gonna be able to top on &quot;My Name is..&quot;  And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation  to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations  And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)..  to deal with these cocky caucasians who think  I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk   with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin   the same fuckin questions (fuckin questions)..  What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in  The why, the who what when, the where, and the how  'til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out  cause they drivin me crazy (drivin me crazy).. I can't take it   I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit  And I'm thankful for ev-ery fan that I get  But I can't take a SHIT, in the bathroom  without someone standin by it  No I won't sign your autograph  You can call me an asshole I'm glad    Chorus (except change first word &quot;Cause&quot; to &quot;And&quot;)</template>

Verse 1  I've created a monster, cuz nobody wants to  see Marshall no more they want Shady I'm chopped liver  well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya  a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor  some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart quicker then a  shock when I get shocked at the hospital by the Dr. when I'm not cooperating  when I'm rocking the table while he's operating   you waited this long now stop debating cuz I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating  I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney but your husbands heart problem's complicating   So the FCC wont let me be or let me be me so let me see  they tried to shut me down on MTV but it feels so empty without me  So come on and dip, bum on your lips fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready cuz this shit's about to get heavy  I just settled all my lawsuits Fuck YOU DEBBIE!     Chorus (X2)  Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me  cuz we need a little controversy, cuz it feels so empty without me     Verse 2  Little hellions kids feeling rebellious  embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis  they start feeling the prisoners helpless, 'til someone comes along on a mission and yells &quot;bitch&quot;  A visionary, vision is scary, could start a revolution, pollutin the air waves a rebel  so let me just revel an ask, the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass  and it's a disaster such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me?  Well I'm back (batman sound) fix your bent antennae tune it in and then I'm gonna  enter in and up under your skin like a splinter  The center of attention back for the winter  I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling  Infesting in your kids ears and nesting  Testing &quot;Attention Please&quot; feel the tension soon as someone mentions me  here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free  A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?     Chorus (X2)    Verse 3  A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit that shit. Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked  worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards, and Moby  you can get stomped by Obie, you 36 year old bald headed fag blow me  You don't know me, you're too old let go its over, nobody listens to techno  Now lets go, give me the signal I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults  I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol  But sometimes the shit just seems, everybody only wants to discuss me  So this must mean I'm disgusting, but its just me I'm just obscene  Though I'm not the first king of controversy  I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley, to do Black Music so selfishly  and use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)  there's a concept that works  20 million other white rappers emerge  but no matter how many fish in the sea it'd be so empty without me     Chorus (X2)    (Hum dei dei la la Hum dei dei la la... la la la) X2 &quot;Kids&quot;</template>
