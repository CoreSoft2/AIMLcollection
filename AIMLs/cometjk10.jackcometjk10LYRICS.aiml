 <template>Where�s my snare?  I have no snare in my headphones,  There you go, yeah, yo, yo,  [Verse 1]  Have you ever been hated, or discriminated against?  I have, I�ve been protested and demonstrated against,  Picket signs for my wicked rhymes,  look at the times, sick as the mind,  Of the mother fucking kid that�s behind all this commotion, emotions, run deep as oceans exploding take flaring from parents just blow him off and keep goin now,  Taking nothing from no one give him hell as long as I�m breathing,  Be kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening,  Leave �em with the taste sour as vinegar in their mouth,  See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out,  Look at me now, I�ll bet your probably sick of me now,  Ain't you Mama?  I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!  [type &quot;Ahm Sorry Momma 2&quot; to see the more of the lyrics]</template>

No I don�t, on second thought, I just fucking wish he would die!  I look at Hailey and I couldn�t picture leaving her side,  Even if I hated Kim I�d grit my teeth and I try to make it work with her at least for Hailey's sake,  I maybe made some mistakes but I�m only human, but I�m man enough to face �em today,  What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb,  But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun �cause I'da killed em,  Shit, I woulda shot Kim and �em both,  It�s my life, I�d like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem Show  [type &quot;I'm Sorry Momma 3&quot; for more of the lyrics]</template>

Wasn�t it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma!  So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma!

See what hurts me the most is you won�t admit you was wrong,  Bitch, do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom,  But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get,  You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit,  Remember when Ronny died, and you said you'd wished it was me?  Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!    [Chorus]   I'm sorry Mama  I never meant to hurt you  I never meant to make you cry  But tonight I'm cleaning out my closet    (One more time)I said I'm sorry mama  I never meant to hurt you  I never meant to make you cry  But tonight I'm cleaning out my closet</template>

Be... cause... you... don't... know us at all we laugh when old people fall,  But what would you expect with a conscience so small?  Heavy metal and mullets is how we were raised, Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised,  'Cause we like having fun at other peoples' expense and  Cutting people down is just a minor offense then,  Its none of your concern,  I guess I'll never learn,  I'm sick of being told to wait my turn,  [type &quot;Fat Lip 2&quot; to see the rest of the lyrics]</template>

 <pattern>MOTIVATION</pattern>
 <template>What's the difference of never knowing at all?  When every step I take is always too small.  Maybe it's just something I can't admit but lately,  I feel like I don't give a shit    Motivation such an aggravation,  Accusations don't know how to take them,  Inspiration's getting hard to fake it.  Concentration's  never hard to break it.  Situation never what you want it to be    What's the point of never making mistakes?  Self-indulgence such a hard habit to break.  It's all just a waste of time in the end.  I don't care so why should I even pretend.    Motivation such an aggravation,  Accusations don't know how to take them,  Inspiration's getting hard to fake it.  Concentration's  never hard to break it.  Situation never what you wanted    Nothing's new, everything's the same.  Keeps on dragging me down, it's getting kind of lame.  Falling further behind, there's nothing to explain.  No matter what you say nothing's gonna change my mind.    Can't depend on doubt until the end.  It seems like leaving friends has become  This years trend and though I can't pretend.  Im framed to be this way  It's not the same but who's to blame.  For all those stupid things I never said.    Motivation such an aggravation,  Accusations don't know how to take them,  Inspiration's getting hard to fake it.  Concentration's  never hard to break it.    Motivation such an aggravation,  Accusations don't know how to take them,  Inspiration's getting hard to fake it.  Concentration  Situation never what you want it to be.
