Are you read to start? <nextreply> My Orlando Day! <BR> One day me and my friend Amy were walking down the street. Suddenly she stops dead in her tracks! When i look at her she is pointing across the street, and as i follow he finger, i realise why she stopped dead, Orlando Bloom was walking down the other side of the street! <nextreply> She grabs my hand and drags me across the street so we arent to far away from him, and him walking in our direction! Amy tells you to go bump into him and drop your stuff like how the girl always does in the movies! What do you do: <BR> Bump into him or Not? (type Bump, of Not)! <settopic=orlistory></template>

What are you going to do? Follow him or Let him go! (type Follow to follow, or Let go to say good-bye)</template>
