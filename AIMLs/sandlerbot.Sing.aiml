 <pattern>SING EYE OF THE TIGER</pattern>
 <template><body> Risin' up, back on the street Took my time, took my chances Went the distance Now I'm back on my feet Just a man and his will to survive So many times, it happened too fast You trade your passion for glory Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past You must fight just to keep them alive 1-It's the eye of the tiger It's the thrill of the fight Risin' up to the challenge Of our rival And the last known survivor Stalks his prey in the night And his fortune must always be Eye of the tiger Face to face, out in the heat Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry They stack the odds Still we take to the street For the kill with the skill to survive (repeat 1) Risin' up straight to the top Had the guts, got the glory Went the distance Now I'm not gonna stop Just a man and his will to survive (repeat 1) The eye of the tiger </body</template>
