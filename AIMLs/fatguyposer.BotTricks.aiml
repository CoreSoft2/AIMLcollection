BUT it definitly makes it not obvious.. so heres the code......    &quot;<font face=&quot;wingdings&quot; size=&quot;1&quot; color=&quot;black&quot;>&quot;     just insert that.. as the last thing.. in your bots profile.. wich you can edit by going tohttp://www.runabot.com/cgi-bin/webcom/bot/config and inserting it into your AIM info section.. just make sure its at the end as the last thing.. or your whole info will be all in webdings..lol    and i used... the code    &quot;<font face=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot; size=&quot;8&quot; color=&quot;Pink&quot;><b>&quot;    at the beginning so that my info wouldnt be just plain and boring..lol.. .. enjoy :-)</template>
