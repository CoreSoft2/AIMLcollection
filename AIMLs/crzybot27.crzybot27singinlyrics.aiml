 <pattern>FAINT</pattern>
 <template>thanx for choosin linkin park-faint...  I am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard  Handful of complaints but I can�t help the fact that everybody can see  these scars  I am what I want you to want what I want you to feel  But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you, to just believe  this is real  So I let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do  Face away and pretend that I'm not  But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got    [Chorus]  (I can't feel the way I did before)  (Don't turn your back on me)  (I won't be ignored)</template>

 <pattern>PRAYER</pattern>
 <template>... Another dream that will never come true  Just to compliment your sorrow  Another life that I've taken from you  A gift to add on to your pain and suffering  Another truth you can never believe  Has crippled you completely  All the cries you're beginning to hear  Trapped in your mind, and the sound is deafening    Let me enlighten you  This is the way I pray</template>

 <pattern>STILL WAITING</pattern>
 <template>u've choosen sum 41... CH : So am I still waiting  For this world to stop hating  Can�t find a good reason  Can�t find hope to believe in    Drop dead a bullet to my head  Your words are like a gun in hand  You can�t change the state of the nation  We just need some motivation  Since I have seen no conviction  Just lies and more contradiction  So tell me what would you say  I�d say its time (to listen)</template>
