 <pattern>*CRUSADES*| *CRUSADERS*</pattern>
 <template>I  Introduction<br> Crusades, series of wars by Western European Christians to recapture the Holy Land from the Muslims (see Palestine). The Crusades were first undertaken in 1096 and ended in the late 13th century. The term Crusade was originally applied solely to European efforts to retake from the Muslims the city of Jerusalem, which was sacred to Christians as the site of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. It was later used to designate any military effort by Europeans against non-Christians.    The Crusaders carved out feudal states in the Near East. Thus the Crusades are an important early part of the story of European expansion and colonialism. They mark the first time Western Christendom undertook a military initiative far from home, the first time significant numbers left to carry their culture and religion abroad.    In addition to the campaigns in the East, the Crusading movement includes other wars against Muslims, pagans, and dissident Christians and the general expansion of Christian Europe. In a broad sense the Crusades were an expression of militant Christianity and European expansion. They combined religious interests with secular and military enterprises. Christians learned to live in different cultures, which they learned and absorbed; they also imposed something of their own characteristics on these cultures. The Crusades strongly affected the imagination and aspirations of people at the time, and to this day they are among the most famous chapters of medieval history.  <br><br>II  Origins of the Crusades   Print Preview of Section     After the death of Charlemagne, king of the Franks, in 814 and the subsequent collapse of his empire, Christian Europe was under attack and on the defensive. Magyars, nomadic people from Asia, pillaged eastern and central Europe until the 10th century. Beginning about 800, several centuries of Viking raids disrupted life in northern Europe and even threatened Mediterranean cities. But the greatest threat came from the forces of Islam, militant and victorious in the centuries following the death of their leader, Muhammad, in 632. By the 8th century, Islamic forces had conquered North Africa, the eastern shores of the Mediterranean, and most of Spain. Islamic armies established bases in Italy, greatly reduced the size and power of the Byzantine Empire (the Eastern Roman Empire) and besieged its capital, Constantinople. The Byzantine Empire, which had preserved much of the classical civilization of the Greeks and had defended the eastern Mediterranean from assaults from all sides, was barely able to hold off the enemy. Islam posed the threat of a rival culture and religion, which neither the Vikings nor the Magyars had doneIn the 11th century the balance of power began to swing toward the West. The church became more centralized and stronger from a reform movement to end the practice whereby kings installed important clergy, such as bishops, in office. (See also Investiture Controversy.) Thus for the first time in many years, the popes were able to effectively unite European popular support behind them, a factor that contributed greatly to the popular appeal of the first Crusades.    Furthermore, Europes population was growing, its urban life was beginning to revive, and both long distance and local trade were gradually increasing. European human and economic resources could now support new enterprises on the scale of the Crusades. A growing population and more surplus wealth also meant greater demand for goods from elsewhere. European traders had always looked to the Mediterranean; now they sought greater control of the goods, routes, and profits. Thus worldly interests coincided with religious feelings about the Holy Land and the popes newfound ability to mobilize and focus a great enterprise.  thats is all i can tell you for now.</template>

 <pattern>*GIFU CASTLE*</pattern>
 <template>Gifu-jo, originally called Inabayama-jo, is built atop the 338m Mt. Kinka in Gifu prefecture. A castle was first established here by Nikaido Yukimasa in 1201. Saito Dosan became the master of Inabayama-jo In 1539 and renovated it into what you see today. In 1567 Oda Nobunaga invaded Mino and took Inabayama-jo from Saito Yoshitatsu, the grandson of Saito Dosan. Nobunaga moved his headquarters here from Komaki-jo and renamed it Gifu-jo.   <br>  During the Battle of Sekigahara (1600) Tokugawa's forces captured Gifu Castle which was then controlled by Nobunaga's grandson Hidenobu. Tokugawa had no need for a mountaintop castle so he had it demolished.</template>

 <pattern>*HIMEJI CASTLE*</pattern>
 <template>Toyotomi Hideyoshi first built a small donjon on this site for his campaigns in western Japan from 1577-1580. Ikeda Terumasa, an ally of Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara, was awarded this province (Harima) for his alliance during the war. Ikeda Terumasa built the donjon of Himeji-jo and erected the castle as it is known today. Himeji-jo's nickname Shirasagi-jo means &quot;White Heron Castle&quot; because the main donjon with its three smaller donjon resembles a white heron. Himeji-jo was granted &quot;World Heritage&quot; status by UNESCO in 1993.</template>

 <pattern>*MATSUMOTO CASTLE *</pattern>
 <template>Next to Himeji-jo, Matsumoto-jo is the next best extant castle donjon in Japan. Built by Ishikawa Kazumasa and his son Yasunaga in 1590, Matsumoto-jo is designated a National Treasure. After Hideyoshi took Odawara he stationed Ishikawa Kazumasa in Matsumoto to govern his eastern provinces.     The history of Matsumoto-jo actually begins with a castle called Fukashi-jo which was built by Shimadachi Sadanaga in 1504. That castle was attacked and captured by Takeda Shingen in 1550.</template>

 <template>Nijo-jo began as a mansion built by Nobunaga in 1569. The castle Nijo-jo was erected in 1603 to be Tokugawa Ieyasu's headquarters when he was in Kyoto. The donjon was struck by lightning and burned to the ground in 1750. It was never rebuilt. Ieyasu's palace is filled with beautiful works of art and is very well preserved. It is designated a National Treasure.     The picture above is of the East Main Gate, a designated Important Cultural Property.</template>

Shiba later took the name of the surrounding area and changed his name to Mogami. Mogami's ancestor Mogami Yoshiaki reconstructed the castle into a much larger fortres in 1592. He added the ninomaru and sannomaru, but there was never a large tenshukaku (donjon) that you see at other castles. It did however have three 2 story and one 3 story yagura.   <br>  While Mogami Yoshiaki went to the Battle of Sekigahara with Tokugawa Ieyasu, it is said that Uesugi Kagekatsu's general Naoe Kanetsugu went to attack Yamagata Castle but he could find it as it was buried in thick fog. Thereafter, the castle was also known as kasumigajo, the castle in the haze.   <br>  At his peak after the battle of Sekigahara Yoshiaki controlled land yielding 570,000 koku. Yoshiaki died in 1614 and his successor Iechika died shortly thereafter in 1617. His sucessor Yoshitoshi was reduced to 300,000 koku and later moved to Mikawa. Over time the importance of Yamagata Castle to the Tokugawa rule over Eastern Japan declined, and with it the size of territory controlled by the lord of Yamagat Castle was also reduced.  <br>  Yamagata Castle is well known today for the authentic wooden econstruction of the East Gate. As you can see from the above picture, this is a masugata style gate. The 2 tamon yagura, high stone walled moat, and the walls surrounding the top make it most impregnable.</template>

 <pattern>ALGEBRA</pattern>
 <template>A few basic things to get you on your way! FOIL of course First outer inner last. Use this when multiplying things such as (X + Y) (6 + 7). However if the signs cross eachother out (X- -Y) (6 + 7) it is not neccessary to do outer and inner.   When finding the perimiter of a shape *although it sounds hard* all you have to do is add up the sides!   Area of a triangle= 1/2bh  (base and hight)  Area of a shape= A= LW    (area and legnth and width)  When factoring, look for a GCF (greatest common factor) then a trinomial then the differnece of two squares</template>

 <pattern>EDO CASTLE</pattern>
 <template>The history of Edo-jo dates back to the Heian Period when a fortified palace was built by the Edo clan on this site. In 1457 the Uesugi clan had a vassal construct Edo-jo. The castle remained under the control of the Uesugi family until the coming of the Tokugawa.  <br><br>  Before Tokugawa Ieyasu, Edo (Tokyo) was just another town in the Kanto area. Partly due to Ieyasu's revolutionary city planning, the town of Edo developed at lightning speed and quickly became the social and political center of Japan. The castle, Edo-jo, which was the center of Tokugawa's city, was the largest castle in the world at that time.   <br><br>  In 1657 a great fire swept through Tokyo and destroyed many parts of the castle including the donjon. To this day, the donjon has never been rebuilt. For 264 years, 15 generations of Tokugawa ruled Japan from Edo-jo. The Tokugawa gave up control of the castle when they lost the Boshin war in 1868. The majority of Edo-jo was destroyed by the U.S. bombings of Tokyo during WWII.   <br><br>  Today, a large section of Edo-jo is occupied by the Imperial palace where the emperor and his family reside. The public cannot enter this area but they can enter the Higashi-gyoen (east gardens) and the Honmaru where the donjon once stood. A reconstructed palisade marks the location of the former donjon. It is worth a trip to Edo-jo just to see the immense stone walled moats that remain from the original castle. The stones were simply fitted together and not cemented which is why they were able to withstand the Great Kanto Earthquake without crumbling.</template>

 <pattern>FORMULA | FORMULAS</pattern>
 <template>There are a few basic formulas or theorums to remember in pre algebra, the communitive theory and the distributive theory.  The communitive theory is the idea that multiplication and addition problems can be switched around. EX: 6 + 7 = 7 + 6   or 6 X 7 = 7 X 6. However you CANNOT do this with subtraction and division  The distributive theory is complicated. Usually when using it, you use it in a a problem like this 6(7+8) what you would do is not only multiply the 6 by the same, but by the 8 as well and add. You might also see this 6(7+x) in which case do the same thing except your answer should be 42+6x.  A few other rules to keep in mind: you cannot add or subtract two variables that are not in the same family which means if they dont have the EXACT same variable code such as zy cannot be added to y.</template>

 <pattern>HIMEJI CASTLE</pattern>
 <template>Toyotomi Hideyoshi first built a small donjon on this site for his campaigns in western Japan from 1577-1580. Ikeda Terumasa, an ally of Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara, was awarded this province (Harima) for his alliance during the war. Ikeda Terumasa built the donjon of Himeji-jo and erected the castle as it is known today. Himeji-jo's nickname Shirasagi-jo means &quot;White Heron Castle&quot; because the main donjon with its three smaller donjon resembles a white heron. Himeji-jo was granted &quot;World Heritage&quot; status by UNESCO in 1993.</template>

When he presented the Great Dane to the knight, the knight was horrified. He exclaimed, &quot;You would send a knight out on a dog like this?&quot;<nextreply>Yo mama is so fat she jumped up and when she came down she knocked the earth out of orbit!!!<nextreply>You're just like a telephone -- even a three-year-old can pick you up.<nextreply>Q: What do you get when you cross a fortune teller with a prostitute? <nextreply> A: Your whoroscope!

Marinate steak, then broil: Put steak and remaining three fourths of marinade in a glass dish, turning steak to coat, and marinate at room temperature, turning once, 30 minutes. While steak is marinating, cut apples and mango into 1 by 1/4 -inch sticks. Toss together with juice and chili sauce and season with salt. Preheat broiler. Broil steak on rack of a broiler pan 2 to 3 inches from heat until slightly charred, 2 to 3 minutes on each side for medium meat. Let steak stand 5 minutes. Cut crosswise into 1/4 -inch thick slices, then halve slices crosswise. Toss beef in reserved marinade with salt and pepper to taste and divide among lettuce leaves. Top with fruit and sesame seeds.                                                        okay here's a another it's called Korean Style Barbecue Short Ribs  okay well here's the recipe okay..................  1 cup soy sauce   1/2 cup sugar   1/8 cup sliced green onion   1 tablespoon white sesame seeds   2 tablespoons sesame oil   2 tablespoons ko chu jang (Korean hot pepper sauce)   1 1/2 pounds short ribs (have your butcher cut 1/8-inch thick slices of short ribs, bone attached)    Preheat a grill.

Note: Adjust sweetness or spiciness by adding more or less of either sugar or ko chu jang sauce.       okay here's 1 more  Rice Cake Soup with Wontons (Duk Kook)  Recipe courtesy Hyungshin Song                    3 cups sliced, frozen rice cakes   For the Wontons:   1/4 cabbage (about 1/2 pound)   1/2 pound mung bean sprouts   1 cup firm tofu, chopped   3 scallions, green tops removed   2 cloves garlic, minced   1/4 pound ground lean sirloin   1/3 pound ground pork tenderloin   1/2 tablespoon salt   1 tablespoon sesame oil   1 package gyoza wrappers   Black pepper     For the Soup:   3/4 pound flank steak   3 quarts water   1/2 teaspoon salt   1 teaspoon soy sauce   1 envelope wonton soup base     For Garnish:   1 scallion sliced thinly on the diagonal   1 beaten egg, cooked in one layer and julienned   1 sheet nori (seaweed) cut into 2-inch long julienne      Defrost the rice cakes slowly in the refrigerator; then soak in water for about 4 hours.   Remove and discard the core and outer leaves of the cabbage and trim the leaves of the tough membranes. Blanch the cabbage in boiling, salted water for 1 minute until wilted, then shock in ice water. Roughly chop the cabbage and transfer to a food processor. Pulse until well chopped. Squeeze out excess water and transfer to a large bowl. Blanch the soy bean sprouts in the same boiling, salted water for 1 minute and shock in ice water. Transfer to a food processor and pulse until well chopped. Squeeze out the excess water and add to the cabbage. Stir in the chopped tofu. Transfer the mixture to a cheesecloth lined sieve, place a weighted plate on top of the mixture, and let stand over a bowl in the refrigerator for 2 hours to remove excess water.     Transfer the vegetable mixture to a large bowl and add the scallions, garlic, ground meat, salt, and sesame oil. Mix well.     To assemble the wontons, place a teaspoon of the filling in the center of a gyoza wrapper. Brush the edges with water and pinch the edges to seal. Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.     To make the broth, combine the flank steak and the water in a pot and let simmer for 1 hour. Remove the meat. When cool enough to handle, slice the beef thinly against the grain. Add the salt, soy sauce, and wonton soup base, to the broth. Drain the rice cakes, add them to the broth, and let simmer for 5 minutes. Add the wontons and sliced beef and let simmer for about 10 minutes more</template>

 <pattern>OSAKA CASTLE</pattern>
 <template>Toyotomi Hideyoshi built Osaka-jo in 1583. Hideyoshi, being the great battle expert he was, designed the most formidable castle ever built in Japan. One large moat surrounded the whole castle with only two ways across it. One of those was a small bridge that could be easily defended or even destroyed if necessary. The inner grounds which contained the large donjon were actually built 3 levels above the water level of the moat. Any attacker would have to scale three high stone walls and climb over 3 sets of turrets to get to the inner grounds.   <br><br>  Of course no castle is invincible and in 1615 it fell to the Tokugawa forces. Hideyoshi's heir, Hideyori, committed suiced before being captured. In 1620 Tokugawa completely renovated the entire castle and built a new donjon making the whole castle even bigger and grander than Hideyoshi's original. In 1665 the donjon was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. It was never rebuilt.</template>

Sprinkle each pizza with 1-ounce of the ham and 1-ounce of the cheese. Bake the pizzas in batches. Using a pizza peel carefully place two of the pizzas on the baking stone. Bake the pizzas for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove the pizza from the oven and slice into 4 well thats all i can give you.</template>

 <pattern>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES</pattern>
 <template>President of the United States chief executive officer of the federal government, leader of the executive branch, and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The president has the power to make treaties with other nations, with the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate. The president also appoints, with Senate consent, diplomatic representatives, Supreme Court judges, and many other officials.    The president and vice president are the only government officials in the United States elected by and representing the entire nation. Although the president shares power with Congress and the judiciary, he or she is the most powerful and important officeholder in the country. The president has no vote in Congress but is the single largest source of legislative proposals that become law. As the principal foreign policy maker, the president of the United States has become the world's most important leader in international affairs<br>br>B  Presidential Qualifications and Salary     The Constitution requires presidents to be natural-born citizens of the United States who are at least 35 years of age and have resided in the United States for 14 years. As a tacit statement of Americas commitment to democracy and equal opportunity, the Constitution gave any free white male citizen of the country the opportunity to become president. All males gained the right to become president in 1870 when the 15th Amendment to the Constitution gave African Americans the right to vote. Women were excluded from running for the office until 1920, when the 19th Amendment to the Constitution gave them the right to vote.     The Constitution specifies that presidents receive compensation (salary and benefits) for their work, and Congress sets the specific amount. The salary of presidents cannot be increased or diminished during their term of office. Nor can the president receive additional payments from the federal government or any of the states while in office. The Constitution also disallows presidents and other federal officials from receiving any title of nobility, gift, payment, or official position from a king, prince, or foreign state. All gifts to a president from foreign governments belong to the people of the United States rather than the president.    Congress establishes presidential salaries. Originally, the president earned 25,000, and this was doubled to 50,000 in 1873. In 1907 Congress added an annual 25,000 stipend for expenses connected with the office. The president's salary increased to 75,000 in 1909 and went up again to 100,000 in 1949. At that time the expense allowance also increased to 90,000. In 1969 the salary advanced to 200,000, with 100,000 budgeted for travel and another 50,000 for expenses. In 2000 the salary increased to 390,000 plus 50,000 for expenses. Because the presidents official duties incur far more expenses than the expense budget can cover, agencies of the federal government often assume responsibility for presidential events. The Department of Defense, for example, pays the cost of having a military band perform at White House social functions and ceremonies.    For most of Americas history, retired presidents did not receive a pension. In 1958 Congress passed the Former Presidents Act, which gave retired presidents a pension of 25,000 per year, an office, and a staff. Congress has increased the pension several times. Former presidents now receive a pension that is based on the annual salary of a cabinet secretary, which was 161,200 in 2001. Former presidents have historically been given a generous allowance for office and staff. Beginning with Democrat Bill Clinton, presidents (or their surviving widows or widowers) will receive funds for an office and staff for four and one-half years after they leave office.</template>

 <pattern>THE *FORBIDDEN CITY*</pattern>
 <template>The Forbidden City stands in the center of Beijing. It is protected by high walls and a moat on all four sides and consists of dozens of halls and courtyards. The emperors of two dynasties, the Ming and the Ching, lived here with their families and hundreds of court ladies and palace eunuchs. From their throne in the Forbidden City they governed the country by holding court sessions with their ministers, issuing imperial edicts and initiating military expeditions.     In Chinese the Forbidden City is called Purple Forbidden City. &quot;Purple&quot; doesn't refer to the color of the buildings or walls, but has a mythological origin. It is said that the Emperor of Heaven has his palaces in the region of the North Star, of which purple is the symbolic color. The abode of the temporal emperor, therefore, is supposed to have the same color. The Purple Forbidden City was inaccessible to the common people. Even the highest civil and military officers could not enter it without good reason.     The Forbidden City was completed in 1420 during the Ming Dynasty. It was the home of 24 emperors of the Ming and Ching dynasties. Naturally it was the scene of many important events affecting the course of Chinese history, including political struggles and palace coups, some of them extremely tragic.     After the republican revolution of 1911, the last emperor of the Ching Dynasty, then still a child, abdicated the next year. But he and his family and their entire entourage were allowed to stay in the palaces. They were finally expelled by republican troops in 1924. The Forbidden City was renamed as the Palace Museum and opened to the general public<br><br>Located in the center of Beijing, the Imperial Palace, otherwise known as the Purple Forbidden City, was the royal palace for the Ming and Qing dynasties. It is the largest, the most intact and well-protected palace complex in China and in the world as well. During the past 500 years since its completion in 1420, it had been used by the two feudal dynasties of Ming and Qing with 24 emperors to rule over the country from here. The revolution of 1911 led by Dr Sun Yat-sen put an end to the feudal rule of the Qing in China. The Forbidden City was opened to visitors in 1925. After 1949, the Imperial Palace has undergone renovations part by part, thereby presenting a completely new feature. Covering an area of 720,000 square meters (about 250 acres) it has a floor space totaling around 155,000 square meters with more than 890 palace buildings containing over 9,000 rooms of various sizes. Housed in the palace museum are many historical and cultural relics as well as precious works of art. It is the largest museum of culture and art in China.</template>

 <pattern>THE *ROMAN EMPIRE*</pattern>
 <template>Roman Empire, political system established by Rome that lasted for nearly five centuries. Historians usually date the beginning of the Roman Empire from 27 bc when the Roman Senate gave Gaius Octavius the name Augustus and he became the undisputed emperor after years of bitter civil war. At its peak the empire included lands throughout the Mediterranean world. Rome had first expanded into other parts of Italy and neighboring territories during the Roman Republic (509-27 bc), but made wider conquests and solidified political control of these lands during the empire. The empire lasted until Germanic invasions, economic decline, and internal unrest in the 4th and 5th centuries ad ended Romes ability to dominate such a huge territory. The Romans and their empire gave cultural and political shape to the subsequent history of Europe from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to the present day.     In 44 bc Gaius Julius Caesar, the Roman leader who ruled the Roman Republic as a dictator, was assassinated. Rome descended into more than ten years of civil war and political upheaval. After Caesars heir Gaius Octavius (also known as Octavian) defeated his last rivals, the Senate in 27 bc proclaimed him Augustus, meaning the exalted or holy one. In this way Augustus established the monarchy that became known as the Roman Empire. The Roman Republic, which had lasted nearly 500 years, was dead, never to be revived. The empire would endure for another 500 years until ad 476 (See Ancient Rome).    The emperor Augustus reigned from 27 bc to ad 14 and ruled with absolute power. He reestablished political and social stability and launched two centuries of prosperity called the Roman Peace (Pax Romana). Under his rule the Roman state began its transformation into the greatest and most influential political institution in European history. During the first two centuries ad the empire flourished and added new territories, notably ancient Britain, Arabia, and Dacia (present-day Romania). People from the Roman provinces streamed to Rome, where they became soldiers, bureaucrats, senators, and even emperors. Rome developed into the social, economic, and cultural capital of the Mediterranean world. Despite the attention given to tyrannical and often vicious leaders like the emperors Caligula and Nero, most emperors ruled sensibly and competently until military and economic disasters brought on the political instability of the 3rd century ad.    The Roman Empire encompassed a huge amount of territory, but also allowed people of many different cultures to retain their heritage into modern times. The empire helped to perpetuate the art, literature, and philosophy of the Greeks, the religious and ethical system of the Jews, the new religion of the Christians, Babylonian astronomy and astrology, and cultural elements from Persia, Egypt, and other eastern civilizations. The Romans supplied their own peculiar talents for government, law, and architecture and also spread their Latin language. In this way they created the Greco-Roman synthesis, the rich combination of cultural elements that for two millennia has shaped what we call the Western tradition.</template>
